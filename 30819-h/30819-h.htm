<p><span class="smcap">Gentle Reader</span>,</p>
<p>If you look to move through this little volume in a direct
line, after the present fashion of Railway Travelling, you will
be signally disappointed.&nbsp; Nothing can well be more
circuitous than the route proposed to you, nor more eccentric
than your present guide.&nbsp; This book aspires to the precision
of neither Patterson nor Bradshaw.&nbsp; Let men &ldquo;bloody
with spurring, fiery hot with speed,&rdquo; consult those oracles
of swiftness and rectitude of way: we do not belong to their
manor.&nbsp; We desire to beguile, by a sort of serpentine
irregularity, the occasional tedium of rapid movement.&nbsp; We
move to our journey&rsquo;s end by sundry old-fashioned
circuitous routes.&nbsp; Grudge not, while you are whirled along
a New Road, to loiter mentally upon certain Old Roads, and to
consider as you linger along them the ways and means of transit
which contented our ancestors.&nbsp; Although their coaches were
slow, and their pack-saddles hard as those of the Yanguesan
carriers of La Mancha, yet they <!-- page iv--><a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>reached their
inns in time, and bequeathed to you and me&mdash;Gentle
Reader&mdash;if we have the grace to use them, many pithy and
profitable records of their wayfaring.&nbsp; The battle is not
always to the strong, nor the race to the swift: neither is the
most rapid always the pleasantest journey.&nbsp; Horace
accompanied M&aelig;cenas on very urgent business, yet he
loitered on the way, and confesses his slackness without
shame&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hoc iter ignavi divisimus, altius ac nos<br
/>
Pr&aelig;cinctis unum: minus est gravis Appia tardis.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was, he says, more comfortable to take his time.&nbsp; Is
our business more pressing than his was?&nbsp; It can hardly be,
seeing that he wended with a company whose errand was to prevent
the two masters of the world from coming to blows.&nbsp; In
comparison with such a mission, who will put the buying of a
cargo of cotton, or arriving an hour before a public meeting
begins, or catching a pic-nic party just in the nick of
time?&nbsp; St. Bernard rode from sunrise to sunset along the
Lake Leman without once putting his mule out of a walk; so much
delectation the holy man felt in beholding the beauty of the
water and the mountains, and in &ldquo;chewing the cud of his own
sweet or bitter fancies.&rdquo;&nbsp; And good Michel Seigneur de
Montaigne took a week for his journey from Nice to Pisa, although
his horse was one of the smartest trotters in Gascony, merely for
the pleasure he felt in following the by-lanes.&nbsp; And did not
Richard Hooker receive from Bishop Jewell <!-- page v--><a
name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>his blessing
and his walking-staff, and yet with such poor means of speed he
thought not of the weary miles between Exeter and Oxford, but
trudged merrily with a thankful heart for the good oak prop, and
the better blessing?&nbsp; Much less content with his journey was
Richard when he rode to London on a hard-paced nag, that he might
be in time to preach his first sermon at St. Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
And was not this, the hastier of his journeys, the most unlucky
in his life, seeing that it brought him acquainted with that foul
shrew, Joan, his wife, who made his after-days as bitter to him,
patient and godly though he were, as wormwood and
coloquintida?&nbsp; Are not these goodly examples, Christian and
Heathen?&nbsp; Let the Train rush along, you and I will travel at
our own pace.</p>
<p>Neither shall you, if you will be ruled by your present guide,
saunter along the roads of Britain alone, or on known and extant
ways only.&nbsp; Are there not roads which never paid toll, roads
in the waste, roads travelled only in vision, roads once
traversed by the feet of myriads, yet now overgrown by the
forest, or buried deeply in the marsh?&nbsp; Shall we not for
awhile be surveyors of these forgotten highways, and pause beside
the tombs of the kings, or consuls, or Incas, who first levelled
them?&nbsp; The world has moved westward with the daily motion of
the earth.&nbsp; Yet, in the far East lie the most ancient
highways&mdash;whose pavements once echoed with the hurrying feet
of Nimrod&rsquo;s outposts <!-- page vi--><a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>or the
trampling of Agamemnon&rsquo;s rear-guard.&nbsp; It were well to
mark how that ancient chivalry sped along their causeways.</p>
<p>Nor, on our devious route, shall baiting-places be
wanting.&nbsp; Drunken Barnaby stayed not oftener to prove the
ale than we will do:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&AElig;gre jam relicto rure<br />
<i>Securem Aldermanni</i>&mdash;<i>bury</i><br />
Primo petii, qua exosa<br />
Sentina, <span class="smcap">Holburni rosa</span><br />
Me excepit, ordine tali<br />
Appuli <span class="smcap">Gryphem Veteris Bailey</span>:<br />
Ubi experrectum lecto<br />
<span class="smcap">Tres Ciconias</span> indies specto,<br />
Quo victurus, donec &aelig;stas<br />
Rure curas tollet m&aelig;stas:<br />
Ego etiam et Sodales<br />
Nunc <i>Galerum Cardinalis</i><br />
Visitantes, vi Minerv&aelig;<br />
Bibimus ad <i>Cornua Cervi</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our inns may not always be found at the roadside; and we may
possibly ever and anon seem to have missed the track
altogether.&nbsp; Yet we will come into the main line in the end,
and, I trust, part with kindly feelings, when the time has come
for saying</p>

1</span>OLD ROADS AND NEW ROADS.</h2>
<p>We have histories of all kinds in abundance,&mdash;and yet no
good History of Roads.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wines ancient and
modern,&rdquo; &ldquo;Porcelain,&rdquo; &ldquo;Crochet
work,&rdquo; &ldquo;Prisons,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dress,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Drugs,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Canary birds,&rdquo; have all and
each found a chronicler more or less able; and the most stately
and imposing volume we remember ever to have turned over was a
history of &ldquo;Button-making:&rdquo; you saw at once, by the
measured complacency of the style, that the author regarded his
buttons as so many imperial medals.&nbsp; But of roads, except
Bergier&rsquo;s volumes on the Roman Ways, and a few learned yet
rather repulsive treatises in Latin and German, we have
absolutely no readable history.&nbsp; How has it come to pass
that in works upon civilization, so many in number, so few in
worth, there are no chapters devoted to the great arteries of
commerce and communication?&nbsp; The <!-- page 2--><a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>subject of
roads does not appear even on that long list of books which the
good Quintus Fixlein <i>intended</i> to write.&nbsp; Of Railways
indeed, both British and foreign, there are a few interesting
memorials; but Railways are one branch only of a subject which
dates at least from the building of Damascus, earliest of
recorded cities.</p>
<p>Perhaps the very antiquity of roads, and the wide arc of
generations comprised in the subject, have deterred competent
persons from attempting it; yet therefore is it only the more
strange that incompetent persons have not essayed &ldquo;this
great argument,&rdquo; since they generally rush in, where their
betters fear to tread.&nbsp; A history of roads is, in great
measure indeed, a history of civilization itself.&nbsp; For
highways and great cities not merely presuppose the existence of
each other, but are also the issues and exponents of two leading
impulses in the nature of man.&nbsp; Actuated by the
one&mdash;the centripetal instinct&mdash;the shepherd races of
Asia founded their great capitals on the banks of the Euphrates
and the Ganges: impelled by the other&mdash;the centrifugal
instinct&mdash;they passed forth from their cradle in the
Armenian Highlands, westward as far as the Atlantic, and eastward
as far as the Pacific.&nbsp; We have indeed indications of roads
earlier than we have accounts of cities.&nbsp; For ages before
Arcadian Evander came as a &ldquo;squatter&rdquo; to Mount
Palatine, was there not the great road of the Hyperboreans from
Ausonia to Delphi, by which, with <!-- page 3--><a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>each revolving
year, the most blameless of mankind conveyed to the Dorian
Sun-god their offerings?&nbsp; And as soon as Theseus&mdash;the
organizer of men, as his name imports&mdash;had slain the wolves
and bears and the biped ruffians of the Corinthian Isthmus, did
he not set up a direction-post, informing the wayfarer that
&ldquo;this side was Peleponnesus, and that side was
Ionia&rdquo;?&nbsp; Centuries of thought and toil indeed
intervened between the path across the plain or down the
mountain-gorge and the Regina Viarum, the Appian Road; and
centuries between the rude stone-heap which marked out to the
thirsting wayfarer the well in the desert, and the stately column
which told the traveller, &ldquo;This is the road to
Byzantium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the land of &ldquo;Geryon&rsquo;s sons,&rdquo; the paths
which scaled the sierras were attributed to the toils of
Hercules.&nbsp; In B&oelig;otia, at a most remote era, there was
a broad carriage-road from Thebes to Phocis, and at one of its
intersections by a second highway the homicide of Laius opened
the &ldquo;long process&rdquo; of woes, which for three
generations enshrouded, as with &ldquo;the gloom of earthquake
and eclipse,&rdquo; the royal house of Labdacus.&nbsp; We have
some doubts about the nature, or indeed the existence, of the
road along which the ass Borak conveyed Mahommed to the seventh
heaven: but we have no grounds for questioning the fact of the
great causeway, which Milton saw in his vision, leading from
Pandemonium to this earth, for have not Sin and Death <!-- page
4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>been
travelling upon it unceasingly for now six thousand years?</p>
<p>From that region beyond the moon, where, according to
Ariosto&mdash;and Milton also vouches for the fact,&mdash;all
things lost on earth are to be found, could we evoke a
Carthaginian ledger, we would gladly purchase it at the cost of
one or two Fathers of the Church.&nbsp; It would inform us of
many things very pleasant and profitable to be known.&nbsp; Among
others it would probably give some inkling of the stages and inns
upon the great road which led from the eastern flank of Mount
Atlas to Berenice, on the Red Sea.&nbsp; This road was in ill
odour with the Egyptians, who, like all close boroughs, dreaded
the approach of strangers and innovations.&nbsp; And the
Carthaginian caravans came much too near the gold-mines of the
Pharaohs to be at all pleasant to those potentates: it was</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&ldquo;much
I wis<br />
To the annoyance of King Amasis.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it is bootless to pine after knowledge irretrievably
buried in oblivion.&nbsp; Otherwise we might fairly have wished
to have stood beside King Nebuchadnezzar when he so unadvisedly
uttered that proud vaunt which ended in his being condemned to a
long course of vegetable diet.&nbsp; For doubtless he gazed upon
at least four main roads which entered the walls of Babylon from
four opposite quarters:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>&ldquo;From Arachosia, from Candaor
east,<br />
And Margiana, to the Hyrcanian cliffs<br />
Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales:<br />
From Atropatia and the neighbouring plains<br />
Of Adiabene, Media, and the south<br />
Of Susiana, to Balsara&rsquo;s havens.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We pass over as a mad imperial whim Caligula&rsquo;s road from
Bai&aelig; to Puteoli, partly because it was a costly and useless
waste of money and labour, and partly because that emperor had an
awkward trick of flinging to the fishes all persons who did not
admire his road.&nbsp; It was a bad imitation of a bad
model&mdash;the road with which Xerxes bridled the
&ldquo;indignant Hellespont.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both the Hellespontine
and the Baian road perished in the lifetime of their founders;
while the Simplon still attests the more sublime and practical
genius of Napoleon.&nbsp; We should have also greatly liked to
watch the Cimbri and Ambrones at their work of piling up those
gigantic earth-mounds in Britain and in Gaul, which, under the
appellation of Devil&rsquo;s-dykes, are still visible and, as
monuments of patient labour and toil, second only to the
construction of the Pyramids.</p>
<p>The physiognomy of races is reflected in their public
works.&nbsp; The warm climate of Egypt was not the only cause for
the long paven corridors which ran underground from temple to
temple, and conducted the Deputies of the Nomes to their
sacerdotal meeting in the great Labyrinth.&nbsp; It was some
advantage, indeed, to travel in the shade in a <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>land where the
summer heats were intense, and refreshing rains of rare
occurrence; but it was a still greater recommendation to these
covered ways that they enabled the priests to assemble without
displaying upon the broad highway of the Nile the times and
numbers of their synods.&nbsp; The pyramidal temples of Benares
communicated by vaulted paths with the Ganges, as the chamber of
Cheops communicated with the Nile.&nbsp; The capital of Assyria
was similarly furnished with covered roads, which enabled the
priests of Bel to communicate with one another, and with the
royal palace, in a city three days&rsquo; journey in length and
three in breadth.&nbsp; Civilization and barbarism, indeed, in
this respect met each another, and the caves of the Troglodyte
&AElig;thiopians on the western shore of the Red Sea were
connected by numerous vaulted passages cut in the solid
limestone, along which the droves of cattle passed securely in
the rainy season to their winter stalls from the meadows of the
Nile and the Astaboras.</p>
<p>Of the civil history of Carthage we know unfortunately but
little.&nbsp; The colonists of Tyre and Sidon are to the ages a
dumb nation.&nbsp; All we know of them is through the accounts of
their bitter foes, the Greeks of Sicily and the Romans.&nbsp; It
is much the same as if the only records of Manchester and
Birmingham were to be transmitted to posterity by the speeches of
Mr. George Frederic Young.&nbsp; Yet we know that the
Carthaginians alone, among <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the nations of
antiquity, made long voyages,&mdash;perchance even doubled the
Cape three thousand years before Vasco de Gama broke the silence
of the southern seas; and we are certain also that their caravan
traffic with Central Africa and the coasts of the Red Sea passed
along defined and permeable roads, with abiding land-marks of
hostelry, well, and column.&nbsp; And we know more than
this.&nbsp; The Romans, who jealously denied to other nations all
the praise for arts or arms which they could withhold, yet
accorded to the Carthaginians the invention of that solid
intessellation of granite-blocks which is beheld still upon the
fragments of the Appian Road.&nbsp; The highways which conveyed
to the warehouses of Carthage the ivory, gold-dust, slaves, and
aromatic gums of Central Libya ran through miles of well-ordered
gardens and by hundreds of villas; and it was the ruthless
destruction of these country-seats of the merchant-princes of
Byrsa, which forced upon them the first and the second peace with
Rome.</p>
<p>The Grecian roads, like the modern European highways,
represented the free genius of the people: they were often
sinuous in their course, and, respecting the boundaries of
property, wound around the hills rather than disturb the ancient
landmarks.&nbsp; Up to a certain point the character of the
Grecian Republics was marked rather by rapid progression than by
permanence.&nbsp; Their roads were of a less massive construction
than the Roman, consisting for <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>the most part
of oblong blocks, and were not very artificially constructed,
except in the neighbourhood of the great emporia of traffic,
Corinth, and Athens, and Syracuse.&nbsp; Sparta possessed two
principal military highways, one in the direction of Argolis, and
another in that of Mycene; but the roads in the interior of
Laconia were little better than drift-ways for the conveyance of
agricultural produce from the field to the garner, or from the
farm-yard to the markets of the capital and the sea-ports.</p>
<p>The Romans were emphatically the road-makers of the ancient
world.&nbsp; An ingenious but somewhat fanciful writer of the
present day has compared the literature of Rome to its great
Vi&aelig;.&nbsp; One idea, he remarks, possessed its poets,
orators, and historians&mdash;the supremacy of the City on the
Seven Hills; and Lucan, Virgil, Livy, and Tacitus, various as
were their idiosyncrasies, still present a formal monotony, which
is not found to the same degree in any other literature.&nbsp;
This censure is, perhaps, as regards the literature of the Roman
people, rather overstated; but it applies literally to their
roads, aqueducts, and tunnels.&nbsp; The State was the be-all and
the end-all of social life: the wishes, the prejudices, the
conveniences of private persons never entered into account with
the planners and finishers of the Appian Way, or the Aqueduct of
Alcantara.&nbsp; The vineyard of Naboth would have been taken
from him by a single <i>senat&ucirc;s consultum</i>, <!-- page
9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>without
the scruples of Ahab and without the crime of Jezebel.&nbsp; The
Roman roads were originally constructed, like our own, of gravel
and beaten stone; the surface was slightly arched, and the
Macadamite principle was well understood by the contractors for
the earliest of the Sabine highways, the Via Salaria <a
name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a>.&nbsp; But after the Romans had borrowed
from Carthage the art of intessellation, their roads were formed
of polygonal blocks of immense thickness, having the interstices
at the angles well filled with flints, and in some instances, as
at Pompeii, with wedges of iron and granite; so that they
resembled on a plane the vertical face of a Cyclopean or
polygonal wall.&nbsp; Upon the roads themselves were imposed the
stately and sonorous epithets of Consular and Pr&aelig;torian;
and had the records of the western Republic perished as
completely as those of its commercial rival, the Appian Road
would have handed down to the remotest ages one of the names of
the pertinacious censor of the Claudian house.&nbsp; To the
Commonwealth, perpetually engaged in distant wars on its
frontiers, it was of the utmost importance to possess the most
rapid means of communicating with its provinces, and of conveying
troops and ammunition.&nbsp; To the <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Empire it was
no less essential to correspond easily with its vast circle of
dependencies.&nbsp; The very life of the citizens, who, long
before the age of Augustus, had ceased to be a corn-producing
people, was sometimes dependent upon the facility of transit, and
the rich plains of Lombardy and Gaul poured in their stores of
wheat and millet, and of salted pork and beef, when the harvest
of Egypt failed through an imperfect inundation of the
Nile.&nbsp; But the convenience of travellers was as much
consulted as the necessity of the subjects of Rome.&nbsp; A
foot-pavement on each side was secured by a low wall against the
intrusion or collision of wheel carriages.&nbsp; Stones to mount
horses (for stirrups were unknown) <a name="citation10"></a><a
href="#footnote10" class="citation">[10]</a> were placed at
certain distances for the behoof of equestrians; and the miles
were marked upon blocks of granite or peperino, the useful
invention of the popular tribune Caius Gracchus.&nbsp; Trees and
fences by the sides were cut to admit air, and ditches, like
ours, carried off the rain and residuary water from the
surface.&nbsp; The office of <i>Curator Viarum</i>, or Road
Surveyor, was bestowed upon the most illustrious members of the
Senate, and the Board of Health in our days may feel some
satisfaction in knowing that Pliny the Younger once held the
office of Commissioner of Sewers on the &AElig;milian <!-- page
11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Road.&nbsp; Nay, the ancients deemed no office tending
to public health and utility beneath them; and after his victory
at Mantinea, Epaminondas was appointed Chairman of the Board of
Scavengers at Thebes.</p>
<p>We close this part of our subject, which must not expand into
an arch&aelig;ological dissertation, with the following extract
from the most eloquent and learned of the English historians who
have treated of Rome.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All these cities were connected with one
another and with the capital by the public highways, which,
issuing from the Forum of Rome, traversed Italy, pervaded the
provinces, and were terminated only by the frontiers of the
empire.&nbsp; If we carefully trace the distance from the wall of
Antoninus to Rome, and from thence to Jerusalem, it will be found
that the great chain of communication, from the north-west to the
south-east point of the empire, was drawn out to the length of
four thousand and eighty Roman miles.&nbsp; The public roads were
accurately divided by milestones, and ran in a direct line from
one city to another, with very little respect for the obstacles
either of nature or of private property.&nbsp; Mountains were
perforated, and bold arches thrown over the broadest and most
rapid streams.&nbsp; The middle part of the road was raised into
a terrace, which commanded the adjacent country, consisted of
several strata of sand, gravel, and cement, and was paved with
large stones, or, in some places <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>near the
capital, with granite.&nbsp; Such was the solid construction of
the Roman highways, whose firmness has not entirely yielded to
the effect of fifteen centuries.&nbsp; They united the subjects
of the most distant provinces by an easy and familiar
intercourse; but their primary object had been to facilitate the
marches of the legions; nor was any country considered as
completely subdued till it had been rendered in all its parts
pervious to the arms and authority of the conqueror.&nbsp; The
advantage of receiving the earliest intelligence, and of
conveying their orders with celerity, induced the emperors to
establish throughout their extensive dominions the regular
institution of posts.&nbsp; Houses were everywhere erected at the
distance only of five or six miles; each of these was constantly
provided with forty horses, and by the help of these relays it
was easy to travel a hundred miles on a day along the Roman
roads.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wherever the Romans conquered they inhabited, and introduced
into all their provinces, from Syene, &ldquo;where the shadow
both way falls,&rdquo; to the <i>ultima Thule</i> of the Scottish
border, the germs of Latin civilization.&nbsp; To this imperial
people England and France owe their first roads; for the
drift-ways along the dykes of the Celts scarcely deserve the
name.&nbsp; The most careless observer must have remarked the
strong resemblance between the right lines and colossal structure
of the Roman Vi&aelig; and the modern Railroad.&nbsp; We have
indeed arrived at <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>a very similar epoch of civilization
to that of the C&aelig;sarian era, but with adjuncts derived from
a purer religion, and from more generous and expanded views of
commerce and the interdependence of nations, than were vouchsafed
by Providence to the ancient world.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Roads being so essential a feature of all political
communities, it might have been expected that if no other feature
of Roman cultivation had survived the wreck of the Empire, the
great arteries of intercourse would at least have been
retained.&nbsp; But the works of man&rsquo;s hand are the
exponent of his ideas; and the ideas of the Teutonic and Celtic
races who divided among themselves the patrimony of the
C&aelig;sars were essentially different from those entertained
and embodied by Greece and Rome.&nbsp; The State ceased to be an
organic and self-attracting body.&nbsp; The individual rather
than the corporate existence of man became the prevalent
conception of the Church and of legislators; and nations sought
rather to isolate themselves from one another, than to coalesce
and correspond.&nbsp; Moreover, the life of antiquity was
eminently municipal.&nbsp; The city was the germ of each body
politic, and the connection of roads with cities is
obvious.&nbsp; But our Teutonic ancestors abhorred civic
life.&nbsp; They generally shunned the towns, even when accident
had placed them in the very centre of their shires or marks, and
when the proximity of great rivers or <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>the
convenience of walls and markets seemed to hold out every
inducement to take possession of the vacant enclosures.&nbsp; The
castle and the cathedral became the nucleus of the Teutonic
cities.&nbsp; Hamlets crept around the precincts of the sacred
and the outworks of the secular building: but it was long before
the Lord Abbot or the Lord Chatelain regarded with any feelings
but disdain, the burgher who exercised his trade or exposed his
wares in the narrow lanes of the town which abutted on his
domains, and enriched his manorial exchequer.</p>
<p>In many cases indeed the Roman cities were allowed to decay:
the forest resumed its rights: the feudal castle was constructed
from the ruins of the Proconsul&rsquo;s palace and the Basilica,
or if these edifices were too massive for demolition, they were
left standing in the waste&mdash;the Mammoths and Saurians of a
bygone civilization.&nbsp; The great Vi&aelig; were for leagues
overgrown with herbage, or concealed by wood and morass; and for
the direct arms of transit which bound Rome and York together as
by the cord of a bow, were substituted the devious and
inconvenient highways, which led the traveller by circuitous
routes from one province to another.&nbsp; The contrast indeed
between the &lsquo;Old Road and the New&rsquo; is represented in
Schiller&rsquo;s fine image&mdash;rendered even finer in
Coleridge&rsquo;s translation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;Straight forward goes<br />
The lightning&rsquo;s path, and straight the fearful path<br />
Of the cannon ball.&nbsp; Direct it flies, and rapid,<br />
Shattering that it may reach, and shattering what it reaches.<br
/>
My son! the road the human being travels,<br />
That on which blessing comes and goes, doth follow<br />
The river&rsquo;s course, the valley&rsquo;s playful windings,<br
/>
Curves round the corn-field and the hill of vines,<br />
Honouring the holy bounds of property:<br />
And thus secure, though late, leads to its end.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was long however before much security was found on the new
roads.&nbsp; In the dark ages the days described by Deborah the
prophetess had returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;The highways were
unoccupied, and the travellers walked through bye-ways: the
villages were deserted.&nbsp; Then was war in the gates, and
noise of the archers in the places of drawing water.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Danger and delay were often the companions of the
traveller.&nbsp; Occasionally a vigorous ruler, like Alfred,
succeeded in restoring security to the wayfarer, and proved his
success (so said the legend) by hanging up, in defiance of the
plunderer, golden armlets on crosses by the roadside.&nbsp; But
these intervals of safety were few and far between, and the
traveller journeyed, like Coleridge&rsquo;s Ancient Mariner,
&ldquo;in fear and dread,&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Because he knew a fearful fiend<br />
Did close behind him tread.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man-at-arms in the days of Border-war was a more
formidable obstacle to progress than a wilderness of
spectres.&nbsp; In the reign of Edward the Confessor the great
highway of Watling Street <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>was beset by
violent men.&nbsp; If you travelled in the eastern counties, the
chances were that you were snapped up by a retainer of Earl
Godwin, and if in the district now traversed by the Great
Northern Railway, Earl Morcar would in all likelihood arrest your
journey, and without so much as asking leave clap a collar round
your neck, with his initials and yours scratched rudely upon it,
signifying to all men, by those presents, that in future your
duty was to tend his swine or rive his blocks.&nbsp; Outlaws,
dwelling in the forests or in the deep morass which girded the
road, pounced upon the traveller on the causeway, eased him of
his luggage if he carried any, and if there was no further
occasion for his services, they either let him down easily into
the next quagmire, or if they were, for those days, gentlemanly
thieves, left him standing, as Justice Shallow has it, like a
&ldquo;forked radish,&rdquo; to enjoy the summer&rsquo;s heat or
the winter&rsquo;s cold.&nbsp; The cross and escallop shell of
the pilgrim were no protection: &ldquo;Cucullus non fecit
monachum&rdquo; in the eyes of these minions of the road; or
rather, perhaps, the hood gave a new zest to the wrongs done to
its wearer by these &ldquo;uncircumcised
Philistines.&rdquo;&nbsp; Convents, the abodes of men professing
at least to be peaceful, were obliged to keep in pay William of
Deloraine to mate with Jock of Thirlstane: and ancient citizens
were fain to put by their grave habiliments, and &ldquo;wield old
partisans in hands as old.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is extant an
agreement made between Leofstan, <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Abbot of St.
Albans, and certain barons, by which the Abbot agrees to hire,
and the barons to let, certain men-at-arms for the security of
the Abbey, and for scouring the forests.&nbsp; Savage capital
punishments&mdash;impalement, mutilation, hanging alive in
chains&mdash;were inflicted on the marauders, who duly
acknowledged these attentions by yet more atrocious severities
upon the wayfarers who had the ill luck to be caught by them.</p>
<p>The insecurity of the old roads necessarily affected the
manners of the time.&nbsp; He should have been a hardy traveller
who would venture himself &ldquo;single and sole,&rdquo; when he
might journey in company.&nbsp; The same cause which leads to the
formation of the caravans of Africa and Asia, led to the
collection of such goodly companies of pilgrims as wended their
way from the Tabard in Southwark to the shrine of St. Thomas at
Canterbury; and the pursuit of travelling under difficulties
produced for all posterity the most delightful of the poems of
the great father of English verse.</p>
<p>Travelling in companies, in times when it was next to
impossible to be on &ldquo;visiting terms with one&rsquo;s
neighbours,&rdquo; tended greatly to the improvement of social
intercourse, and to the erection of roomy and comfortable inns
for the wayfarers.&nbsp; It took Dan Chaucer only a few hours to
be on the best footing with the nine and twenty guests at the
Tabard.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>&ldquo;Befelle that, in that season
<a name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"

To Canterbury with devout corage,<br />
At night was come into that hostelrie<br />

Of sondry folk, by aventure yfalle<br />
In felawship; and pilgrimes were they alle,<br />
That toward Canterbury wolden ride.<br />
The chambres and the stables weren wide,<br />
And wel we weren esed att&egrave; beste.<br />
And shortly, whan the sonne was gone to reste<br />
So hadde I spoken with hem everich on,<br />
That I was of hir felawship anon.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the tenants of the waste and the woodland were not the
only lords of the highway.&nbsp; The Norman baron drew little
profit from the natural produce of his ample domains.&nbsp; In
his way he was a staunch protectionist; but he left agriculture
very <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>much to take care of itself, and looked to his tolls,
his bridges, and above all to his highways, for a more rapid
return of the capital he had invested in accoutring men-at-arms,
squires, and archers.&nbsp; We know, from &lsquo;Ivanhoe,&rsquo;
how it fared with Saxons, Pilgrims, and Jews, whose business led
them near the castles of Front de B&oelig;uf or Philip de
Malvoisin: and we are certain that the Lady of Branksome kept, an
expensive establishment, who were expected to bring grist to the
mill of the lord or lady of the demesne, by turning out in all
weathers and at all hours, whenever a herd of beeves or a company
of pilgrims were descried by the watchers from Branksome
Towers.&nbsp; For it must have taken no small quantity of beef
and hides to furnish the Branksome retainers in dinners and shoe-
and saddle-leather; since&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nine and twenty knights of fame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hung their shields in Branksome Hall:<br />
Nine and twenty squires of name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brought them their steeds to bower from stall:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nine and twenty yeomen tall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waited duteous on them all:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were all knights of mettle
true,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kinsmen to the bold
Buccleugh.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the traveller carried money in his purse, or the merchant
had store of Sheffield whittles or Woodstock gloves in his pack,
the lowest dungeon in the castle of the Bigods was his doom; and
he was a lucky man who came out again from those crypts which now
so much delight our arch&aelig;ological <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>associations,
with a tithe of his possessions, or with his proper allowance of
eyes, hands, and ears.</p>
<p>Even on the Roman roads, with their good accommodation of
pavement, milestones, and towns, journeys were for the most part
performed on foot or horseback.&nbsp; For before steel springs
were invented, it was by no means pleasant to ride all day in a
jolting cart&mdash;and the most gorgeous of the Roman
<i>carruc&aelig;</i>, or coaches, was no better.&nbsp; Pompous
and splendid indeed&mdash;to pass for a moment from Norman and
Saxon barbarism&mdash;must have been the aspect of the Queen of
Roads within a few leagues of the capital of the world; splendid
and pompous as it was to the actual beholder, it is perhaps seen
to best advantage in the following description by
Milton&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thence to the gates cast round thine eye,
and see<br />
What conflux issuing forth, or entering in;<br />
Pr&aelig;tors, proconsuls to their provinces<br />
Hasting or on return, in robes of state,<br />
Lictors and rods, the ensigns of their power,<br />
Legions and cohorts, turms of horse and wings;<br />
Or embassies from regions far remote,<br />
In various habits, on the Appian road,<br />
Or on the &AElig;milian.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a pendant to this breathing picture oftan Old Road at the
gate of the &ldquo;vertex omnium civitatum,&rdquo; we subjoin a
note from Gibbon:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The <i>carruc&aelig;</i> or coaches of the
Romans were often of solid silver, curiously carved and engraved,
and the trappings of the mules or horses were embossed with
gold.&nbsp; This magnificence continued from the <!-- page
21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>reign
of Nero to that of Honorius: and the Appian Road was covered with
the splendid equipages of the nobles who came out to meet St.
Melania, when she returned to Rome, six years before the Gothic
siege.&nbsp; Yet pomp is well exchanged for convenience; and a
plain modern coach, that is hung upon springs, is much preferable
to the silver and gold <i>carts</i> of antiquity, which rolled on
the axle-tree, and were exposed, for the most part, to the
inclemency of the weather.&rdquo; <a name="citation21a"></a><a
href="#footnote21a" class="citation">[21a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Anglo-Saxon generally travelled on horseback.&nbsp; The
Jews were restricted to the ignobler mule.&nbsp; The former
indeed had a species of carriage; and horse-litters, probably for
the use of royal or noble ladies and invalids, are mentioned by
Matthew Paris and William of Malmesbury.&nbsp; Wheel-carriages
appear to have multiplied after the return of the Crusaders from
Palestine&mdash;partly, it may be inferred, because increased
wealth had inspired a taste for novel luxuries, and partly
because the champions of the Cross had imbibed in the Holy War
some of the prejudices of the infidels, and had grown chary of
exposing to vulgar gaze their dames and daughters on horseback.

<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>The speed of travelling depends upon the nature and
facilities of the means of transit.&nbsp; Herodotus mentions a
remarkable example of speed in a Hemerodromus, or running-post,
named Phidippides, who in two days ran from Athens to Sparta, a
distance of nearly 152 English miles, to hasten the Laconian
contingent, when the Persians were landing on the beach of
Marathon.&nbsp; Couriers of this order, trained to speed and
endurance from their infancy, conveyed to Montezuma the tidings
of the disembarkation of Cortes; and so imperfect were the means
of communication at that era in Europe, that the Spaniards noted
it as a proof of high refinement in the Aztecs to employ relays
of running postmen, from all quarters of their empire to the city
on the Great Lake.&nbsp; The speed of a Roman traveller was
probably the greatest possible before the invention of
carriage-springs and railways.&nbsp; We have some data on this
head.&nbsp; The mighty Julius was a rapid traveller.&nbsp; He
continually mentions his <i>summa diligentia</i> in his journal
of the Gaulish Wars.&nbsp; The length of journeys which he
accomplished within a given <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>time, appears
even to us at this day, and might well therefore appear to his
contemporaries, truly astonishing.&nbsp; A distance of one
hundred miles was no extraordinary day&rsquo;s journey for
him.&nbsp; When he did not march with his army on foot,&mdash;as
he often seems to have done, in order to set his soldiers an
example, and also to express that sympathy with them which gained
him their hearts so entirely&mdash;he mostly travelled in a
<i>rheda</i>.&nbsp; This was a four-wheeled carriage, a sort of
curricle, and adapted to the carriage of about half a ton of
luggage.&nbsp; His personal baggage was probably considerable,
for he was a man of most elegant habits, and sedulously attentive
to his personal appearance.&nbsp; The tessellated flooring of his
tent formed part of his <i>impedimenta</i>, and, like Napoleon,
he expected to find amid the distractions of war many of the
comforts and conveniences of his palace at Rome.&nbsp; He reached
the Sierra Morena in twenty-three days from the date of his
leaving Rome; and he went the whole way by land.&nbsp; The
distance round the head of the Gulf of Genoa and through the
passes of the Pyrenees is 850 leagues; and although the
Carthaginians had once been masters of Spanish Navarre, the roads
were far from regular or good.&nbsp; The same distance would now
be accomplished in twelve days by a general and his mounted
staff.&nbsp; From the usual rapidity with which the great
Proconsul travelled, Cowley, in his Essay on
&lsquo;Procrastination,&rsquo; extracts a moral, or, as his <!--
page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>Puritan contemporaries would have phrased it, a
&ldquo;pious use.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;the man of expedition above all others, was so far
from this folly (procrastination), that whensoever in a journey
he was to cross any river, he never went out of his way for a
bridge, or a ford, or a ferry, but flung himself into it
immediately, and swam over; and this is the course we ought to
imitate, if we meet with any stops in our way to
happiness.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the time of Theodosius,
C&aelig;sarius, a magistrate of high rank, went post from Antioch
to Constantinople.&nbsp; He began his journey at night, was in
Cappadocia, 165 miles from Antioch, the ensuing evening, and
arrived at Constantinople the sixth day about noon.&nbsp; The
whole distance was 725 Roman, or 665 English miles.</p>
<p>Gibbon describes bishops as among the most rapid of ancient
travellers.&nbsp; The decease of a patriarch of Alexandria or
Antioch caused the death of scores of post-horses, from the rate
at which anxious divines hurried to Constantinople to solicit
from the Emperor the vacant see.&nbsp; On the whole however, in
respect of speed in travelling, the Greeks and Romans were but
slow coaches; and these exceptional instances merely serve to
prove the general slackness of their pace.&nbsp; A Roman nobleman
indeed, with all the means and appliances which his wealth could
purchase, and with the positive advantage of the best roads in
the world, travelled generally with such a ponderous train, that
<!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>the heavy-armed legions with their parks of artillery
might well advance as rapidly as an Olybrius or Anicius of the
Empire.&nbsp; &ldquo;In their journeys into the country,&rdquo;
says Ammianus, &ldquo;the whole body of the household marches
with their master.&nbsp; In the same manner as the cavalry and
infantry, the heavy and the light armed troops, the advanced
guard and the rear, are marshalled by the skill of their military
leaders; so the domestic officers who bear the rod, as an ensign
of authority, distribute and arrange the numerous train of slaves
and attendants.&nbsp; The baggage and wardrobe move in the front;
and are immediately followed by a multitude of cooks and inferior
ministers, employed in the service of the kitchen and of the
table.&nbsp; The main body is composed of a promiscuous crowd of
slaves, increased by the accidental concourse of idle or
dependent plebeians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At an even earlier period, in the age of Nero, before luxury
had made the gigantic strides which distinguished and disgraced
the Byzantine Court, Seneca records three circumstances relative
to the journeys of the Roman nobility.&nbsp; They were preceded
by a troop of Numidian light horse who announced by a cloud of
dust the approach of a great man.&nbsp; Their baggage-mules
transported not only the precious vases, but even the fragile
vessels of crystal and <i>murra</i>, which last probably meant
the porcelain of China and Japan.&nbsp; The delicate faces of the
young slaves were covered with a medicated <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>crust or
ointment, which secured them against the effects of the sun and
frost.&nbsp; Rightly did the Romans name their baggage
<i>impedimenta</i>.&nbsp; A funeral pace was the utmost that
could be expected from travellers so particular about their
accommodations as these luxurious senators.&nbsp; Of a much
humbler character was the state observed by the monarchs who
succeeded to portions of the empire of the C&aelig;sars.&nbsp;
The Merovingian kings, when they employed wheel carriages at all,
rode in wains drawn by bullocks; the Bretwaldas of the Saxon
kingdoms went to temple or church on high festivals in the same
cumbrous fashion; and &ldquo;slow oxen&rdquo; dragged the
standard of the Italian Republics into the battle-field.</p>
<p>With the disuse or breaking up of the great Roman Vi&aelig; in
our island, the difficulty and delay of travelling increased, and
more than thirteen centuries elapsed before it was again possible
to journey with any tolerable speed.&nbsp; Wolsey indeed, it is
well known, by the singular rapidity with which he conveyed royal
letters to and from Brussels, galloped swiftly up the road of
royal favour: and by his fast style of living at home afterwards
galloped even more swiftly down again.&nbsp; Mordaunt, Earl of
Peterborough, was noted for his incessant restlessness, and his
rapid mode of passing from one land to another; but then he
dispensed with all state and attendance, and rode like a post-boy
from one end of Europe to another.&nbsp; As the readers <!-- page
27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>of
Pope, Swift, and their contemporaries are daily becoming fewer in
number, we venture to extract the Dean&rsquo;s pleasant burlesque
on this eccentric nobleman&rsquo;s migratory habits.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mordanto fills the trump of fame,<br />
The Christian worlds his deeds proclaim,<br />
And prints are crowded with his name.</p>
<p>In journeys he outrides the post,<br />
Sits up till midnight with his host,<br />
Talks politics and gives the toast;</p>
<p>Knows every prince in Europe&rsquo;s face,<br />
Flies like a squib from place to place,<br />
And travels not, but runs a race.</p>
<p>From Paris gazette &agrave;-la-main,<br />
This day arrived, without his train,<br />
Mordanto in a week from Spain.</p>
<p>A messenger comes all a-reek,<br />
Mordanto at Madrid to seek;<br />
He left the town above a week.</p>
<p>Next day the post-boy winds his horn,<br />
And rides through Dover in the morn;<br />
Mordanto&rsquo;s landed from Leghorn.</p>
<p>Mordanto gallops on alone;<br />
The roads are with his followers strown;<br />
This breaks a girth and that a bone.</p>
<p>His body active as his mind,<br />
Returning sound in limb and wind,<br />
Except some leather lost behind.</p>
<p>A skeleton in outward figure,<br />
His meagre corpse, though full of vigour,<br />
Would halt behind him, were it bigger.</p>
<p>So wonderful his expedition,<br />
When you have not the least suspicion<br />
He&rsquo;s with you like an apparition.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The badness of the roads and the rude forms of <!-- page
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>wheel-carriages added to the expense of
travelling.&nbsp; A canon of Salisbury Cathedral may now travel
to London at a cost which is scarcely felt by his prebendal
income: but in the days of Peter of Blois the whole proceeds of a
stall were inadequate to the expenses of such a journey.&nbsp; In
the thirteenth century a bishop of Hereford was detained at
Wantling by lack of money for post-horses, and but for the aid of
some pious monastery or peccant baron in the neighbourhood, who
seized the opportunity of compounding for his sins, the successor
of the apostles must, like the apostles, have completed his
journey on foot.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth century roads were so far improved, that
jobbing horses became a regular business, and the licenses for
hackneys and guides added to the returns of the exchequer.&nbsp;
A fare of twelvepence was paid for horse-hire from Southwark to
Rochester; and sixpence was the charge of conveyance from
Canterbury to Dover.&nbsp; We do not know the rate at which the
equestrians travelled.&nbsp; Ancient Pistol informs us that
&ldquo;the hollow-pampered jades of Asia could go but thirty
miles a-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; But these cattle seem to have been like
Jeshurun, fat and perchance kicking, and accustomed to the tardy
pace of Asiatic pomp.</p>
<p>Shakspeare and Steele both expatiate on the casualties
incident to riding upon hired horses.&nbsp; Petruchio and
Catherine, like Dr. Samuel Johnson and Hetty, made their wedding
tour on horseback; <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>and each trip ended with a similar
result&mdash;the temporary obedience of the fair brides to the
marital yokes.&nbsp; After this fashion Grumio tells the story of
the connubial ride:&mdash;&ldquo;We came down a foul hill, my
master riding behind my mistress.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Both on one
horse?&rdquo; says Curtis, apparently unacquainted with the
fashion of pillions.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to
thee?&rdquo; rejoins Grumio.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell thou the
tale.&nbsp; But hadst thou not crossed me, thou shouldst have
heard how her horse fell, and she under her horse; thou shouldst
have heard in how miry a place; how she was bemoiled; how he left
her with the horse upon her; how he beat me because her horse
stumbled; how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me; how
he swore; how she prayed; how I cried; how the horses ran away;
how her bridle was burst; how I lost my crupper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Petruchio rode a hired horse is rendered probable by the
wretched character of his steed and its furniture.&nbsp; Hudibras
or Don Quixote were not worse mounted than was the Shrew-tamer:
seeing that his horse was &ldquo;hipped with an old mothy saddle,
the stirrups of no kindred; besides, possessed with the glanders,
and like to mose in the chine; troubled with the lampass,
infected with the fashions, full of wind-galls, sped with
spavins, raied with the yellows, past cure of the fives, stark
spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the bots; swayed in the
back and shoulder-shotten, near-legged before, and with a
half-checked bit, <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>and a headstall of sheep&rsquo;s
leather; which, being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath
been often burst, and now repaired with knots; one girt six times
pieced, and a woman&rsquo;s crupper of velure, here and there
pieced with packthread.&rdquo; <a name="citation30"></a><a
href="#footnote30" class="citation">[30]</a></p>
<p>Steele (Tatler, No. 231) has borrowed, without any
acknowledgement, from &lsquo;Taming the Shrew,&rsquo; most of the
circumstances of his story; yet his adoption of them shows that
such a mode of travelling was still in common use in the
seventeenth century.&nbsp; After the honey-moon was over, the
bridegroom made preparations for conveying his new spouse to her
future abode.&nbsp; But &ldquo;instead of a coach and six horses,
together with the gay equipage suitable to the occasion, he
appeared without a servant, mounted on a skeleton of a horse
which his huntsman had, the day before, brought in to feast his
dogs on the arrival of their new mistress, with a pillion fixed
behind, and a case of pistols before him, attended only by a
favourite hound.&nbsp; Thus equipped, he, in a very obliging, but
somewhat positive manner, desired his lady to seat herself on the
cushion; which <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>done, away they crawled.&nbsp; The
road being obstructed by a gate, the dog was commanded to open
it; the poor cur looked up and wagged his tail: but the master,
to show the impatience of his temper, drew a pistol and shot him
dead.&nbsp; He had no sooner done it, but he fell into a thousand
apologies for his unhappy rashness, and begged as many pardons
for his excesses before one for whom he had so profound a
respect.&nbsp; Soon after their steed stumbled, but with some
difficulty recovered; however, the bridegroom took occasion to
swear, if he frightened his wife so again, he would run him
through!&nbsp; And, alas! the poor animal, being now almost
tired, made a second trip; immediately on which the careful
husband alights, and with great ceremony first takes off his
lady, then the accoutrements, draws his sword, and saves the
huntsman the trouble of killing him: then says he to his wife,
&lsquo;Child, prithee take up the saddle;&rsquo; which she
readily did, and tugged it home, where they found all things in
the greatest order, suitable to their fortune and the present
occasion.&rdquo;&nbsp; This veracious history proceeds to say
that, after this practical lesson, the lady was ever remarkable
for a sweet and compliant temper.</p>
<p>Cotton&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;cheerful hearty Mr.
Cotton&rdquo;&mdash;description of a post-horse may be less
familiarly known to the reader than either of the preceding
descriptions of the inconveniences of riding post: it describes a
journey from the neighbourhood of Bakewell to Holyhead, about the
year 1678.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span

demanded great vails,<br />
For conducting me over the mountains of Wales:<br />
Twenty good shillings, which sure very large is;<br />
Yet that would not serve, but I must bear his charges:<br />
And yet for all that, rode astride on a beast,<br />
The worst that e&rsquo;er went on three legs, I protest.<br />
It certainly was the most ugly of jades:<br />
His hips and his rump made a right ace of spades;<br />
His sides were two ladders, well spur-galled withal;<br />
His neck was a helve, and his head was a mall;<br />
For his colour, my pains and your trouble I&rsquo;ll spare,<br />
For the creature was wholly denuded of hair,<br />
And, except for two things, as bare as my nail,&mdash;<br />
A tuft of a mane and a sprig of a tail.<br />
Now such as the beast was, even such was the rider,<br />
With head like a nutmeg, and legs like a spider;<br />
A voice like a cricket, a look like a rat,<br />
The brains of a goose, and the heart of a cat:<br />
But now with our horses, what sound and what rotten,<br />
Down to the shore, you must know, we were gotten;<br />
And there we were told, it concerned us to ride,<br />
Unless we did mean to encounter the tide.<br />
And then my guide lab&rsquo;ring with heels and with hands,<br />
With two up and one down, hopped over the sands;<br />
Till his horse, finding the labour for three legs too sore,<br />
Foled out a new leg, and then he had four.<br />
And now, by plain dint of hard spurring and whipping,<br />
Dry-shod we came where folks sometimes take shipping.<br />
And now hur in Wales is, Saint Taph be hur speed,<br />
Gott splutter hur taste, some Welsh ale hur had need:<br />
Yet surely the Welsh are not wise of their fuddle,<br />
For this had the taste and complexion of puddle.<br />
From thence then we marched, full as dry as we came,<br />
My guide before prancing, his steed no more lame,<br />
O&rsquo;er hills and o&rsquo;er valleys uncouth and uneven,<br />
Until, &rsquo;twixt the hours of twelve and eleven,<br />

<p>Cotton&rsquo;s ride to Holyhead was not however <!-- page
33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>nearly so diversified in its adventures as a journey
from Hardwick to Bakewell about the same period, described by
Edward, son of Sir Thomas Browne, the worthy knight and physician
of Norwich.</p>
<p>A tour in Derbyshire, in the year 1622, was indeed no light
matter.&nbsp; Our ancestors were much in the right to make their
wills before encountering the perils of a ride across the
moors.&nbsp; We are constrained to abridge the author&rsquo;s
narrative, but the main incidents of it are preserved in our
transcript.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This day broke very rudely upon us.&nbsp; I
never travelled before in such a lamentable day both for weather
and way, but we made shift to ride sixteen mile that morning, to
Chesterfield in Derbyshire, passing by Bolsover Castle, belonging
to the Earl of Newcastle, very finely seated upon a high hill;
and missing our way once or twice, we rode up mountain, down
dale, till we came to our inn, when we were glad to go to bed at
noon.&nbsp; It was impossible to ride above two mile an hour in
this stormy weather: but coming to our inn, by the ostler&rsquo;s
help having lifted our crampt legs off our horses, we crawled
upstairs to a fire, when in two hours&rsquo; time we had so well
dried ourselves without and liquored ourselves within, that we
began to be so valiant as to think upon a second march; but
inquiring after the business, we received great discouragement,
with some stories of a moor, which they told us we must go
over.&nbsp; We had by chance <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>lighted on a
house that was noted for good drink and a shovel-borde table,
which had invited some Derbyshire blades that lived at Bakewell,
but were then at Chesterfield about some business, to take a
strengthening cup before they would encounter with their journey
home that night.&nbsp; We, hearing of them, were desirous to ride
in company with them, so as we might be conducted in this
strange, mountainous, misty, moorish, rocky, wild country; but
they, having drank freely of their ale, which inclined them
something to their countrie&rsquo;s natural rudeness, and the
distaste they took at our swords and pistols with which we rid,
made them loth to be troubled with our companies, till I, being
more loth to lose this opportunity than the other (one of which
had voted to lie in bed the rest of the day), went into the room
and persuaded them so well, as they were willing, not only to
afford us their company, but stayed for us till we accoutred
ourselves.&nbsp; And so we most courageously set forward again,
the weather being not one whit better, and the way far worse; for
the great quantity of rain that fell, came down in floods from
the tops of the hills, washing down mud, and so making a bog in
every valley; the craggy ascents, the rocky unevenness of the
roads, the high peaks, and the almost perpendicular descents,
that we were to ride down: but what was worse than all this, the
furious speed that our conductors, mounted upon such good horses,
used to these hills, led us on with, <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>put us into
such an amazement, as we knew not what to do, for our pace we
rode would neither give us opportunity to speak with them or to
consult with one another, till at length a friendly bough that
had sprouted out beyond his fellows over the road, gave our file
leader such a brush of the jacket as it swept him off his horse,
and the poor jade, not caring for its master&rsquo;s company, ran
away without him: by this means, while some went to get his
courser for him, others had time to come up to a general
<i>rendezvous</i>; and concluded to ride more soberly: but I
think that was very hard for some of these to do.&nbsp; Being all
up again, our light-horsed companions thundered away, and our
poor jades, I think, being afraid, as well as their masters, to
be left alone in this desolate wide country, made so much haste
as they could after them; and this pace we rid, till we lost
sight of one another.&nbsp; At last our leaders were so civil,
when it was almost too late, to make another halt at the top of
one of the highest hills thereabout, just before we were to go to
the moor: and I was the last that got up to them, where, missing
one of my companions who was not able to keep up with us, I was
in the greatest perplexity imaginable, and desiring them to stay
awhile, I rid back again, whooping and hallooing out to my lost
friend; but no creature could I see or hear of, till at last,
being afraid I had run myself into the same inconvenience, I
turned back again towards the mountaineers, <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>whom when I
had recovered, they told me &rsquo;t was no staying there, and
&rsquo;t were better to kill our horses than to be left in those
thick mists, the day now drawing to an end: and so setting spurs
to their horses, they ran down a precipice, and in a short time
we had the favour to be rained on again, for at the top of this
hill we were drencht in the clouds themselves, which came not
upon us drop by drop, but cloud after cloud came puffing over the
hill as if they themselves had been out of breath with climbing
it.&nbsp; Here all our tackling failed, and he that fared best
was wet to the skin, these rains soaking through the thickest
lined cloak: and now we were encountering with the wild moor,
which, by the stories we had been told of it, we might have
imagined a wild bore.&nbsp; I am sure it made us all grunt before
we could get over it, it was such an uneven rocky track of road,
full of great holes, and at that time swells with such rapid
currents, as we had made most pitiful shift, if we had not been
accommodated with a most excellent conductor; who yet, for all
his haste, fell over his horse&rsquo;s head as he was plunging
into some dirty hole, but by good luck smit his face into a soft
place of mud, where I suppose he had a mouth full both of dirt
and rotten stick, for he seemed to us to spit crow&rsquo;s nest a
good while after.&nbsp; Now, being forced to abate something of
their speed, I renewed my acquaintance with two of our new
companions, and made them understand how we <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>had left a
third man behind us, not being able to ride so fast, and how our
intentions were to stay at their own town with them this night,
who now overjoyed to see an old acquaintance, were so kind and
loving that what with shaking hands, riding abreast, in this bad
way, and other expressions of their civilities, they put me in as
much trouble with their favour as before they had put me to
inconvenience by their rudeness: yet, by this means, I procured
them to ride so easily as I led my horse down the next steep
hill, on the side of which lay a vast number of huge stones, one
intire stone of them being as big as an ordinary house: some of
the smaller they cut into mill-stones.&nbsp; Passing the
river&mdash;Derwent&mdash;which then ran with the strongest
current that ever I beheld any, we climbed over another hill, a
mile up and a mile down, and got to Bakewell a little after it
was dark.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have a few data of the speed possible in travelling on
extraordinary occasions.&nbsp; We select one of each
kind&mdash;that of the mounted express and that of the Great Lady
who kept her carriage, as the extremes, so far as regards the
instruments of conveyance.&nbsp; For a horseman can go where a
wheel-carriage cannot find a track: and on the other hand, the
traveller on foot can generally choose a more direct line of
movement, than is practicable for the four-footed servant of man,
encumbered with his rider and his furniture.</p>
<p>In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the <!-- page
38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>herald of the king of Scotland, who, it may be supposed,
carried with him a royal mandate to be first served by the livery
stables, was allowed forty days to reach the Border from London,
although it appears that Robert Bruce took only seven to put the
Border between himself and Gloucester.&nbsp; But neither Bruce
nor the mother of Richard II., who came in one day from
Canterbury to London, can be taken as precedents of ordinary
speed.&nbsp; For the one had received a significant hint from
some friendly courtier&mdash;a pair of spurs baked in a
pie&mdash;that King Edward was in high dudgeon with him, and
could not dine with either appetite or good digestion, until he
had seen Bruce&rsquo;s head: and of the Queen dowager is it not
written that &ldquo;she never durst tarry on the waye,&rdquo; for
Wat Tyler was behind her, vowing vengeance upon all
principalities and powers?&nbsp; Howbeit her majesty was so
thoroughly jolted and unsettled by the &ldquo;slapping
pace&rdquo; at which she travelled, that she had a bilious attack
forthwith, and was &ldquo;sore syke, and like to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the difficulty of transit on roads was owing the
establishment of great annual fairs, still imperfectly
represented by our Wakes, Statute-fairs, and periodical
assemblages of itinerant vendors of goods.&nbsp; These commercial
re-unions are still common in the East, and still frequent in
Central Europe; although in England, where every hamlet has now
happily its general shop, and where the towns <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>rival the
metropolis in the splendour of gas-lamps and the glory of
plate-glass windows, such Fairs have degenerated into yearly
displays of giants, dwarfs, double-bodied calves, and gorgeous
works in gingerbread.&nbsp; To our ancestors, with their simpler
habits of living, supply and demand, these annual meetings served
as permanent divisions of the year.&nbsp; The good housewife who
bought her woollens and her grocery, the yeoman who chose his
frieze-coat, his gay waistcoat, and the leathern integuments of
his sturdy props, once only in twelve months, would compute the
events of his life after the following fashion:&mdash;&ldquo;It
happened three months after last Bury or Chester Fair;&rdquo; or,
&ldquo;Please Heaven, the bullocks shall be slaughtered the week
before the next Statute.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nay, dates were often
extracted, in the courts of justice, by the help of such
periodical memoranda.&nbsp; The Church of Rome, with its unerring
skill in absorbing and insinuating itself into all the business
or pleasures of mankind, did not overlook these popular
gatherings.&nbsp; And if the ascetic Anthony, the sturdy
Christopher, or that &ldquo;painful martyr,&rdquo; St.
Bartholomew, minded earthly matters in the regions of their
several beatitudes, they must have been often more scandalized
than edified by the boisterous amusements of those who celebrated
their respective Feasts.&nbsp; In these particulars, however,
Ecclesiastical Rome was merely a borrower from its elder Pagan
sister.&nbsp; The Compitalia of ancient Rome were street-fairs
<!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>dedicated to the worship of local deities, and the
Thirty cities of Latium held annually, on the slope of the Alban
Mount, a great fair as well as a great council of Duumviri and
Decuriones.&nbsp; To the ancient fairs of Southern Italy we are
indebted for one of our oldest and most agreeable
acquaintances.&nbsp; The swinging puppets of the Oscans were
gradually confined within a portable box, and danced or
gesticulated upon a miniature stage.&nbsp; Their dumb-show was
relieved by the extemporary jests and songs of the showman, until
at length, one propitious morning, some Homer or Shakspeare of
the streets conceived the sublime idea of embodying these
scattered rays of satire and jest in the portly person
of&mdash;Mr. Punch.</p>
<p>The original fair of the East and medi&aelig;val Europe was
one of the most instructive and picturesque spectacles among the
many gatherings of the human race.&nbsp; The Great Fair of
Novogorod assembled, and still continues to assemble, myriads of
nearly every colour and costume: and in the market of &ldquo;the
Sledded Russ&rdquo; the small-eyed Chinese stood side by side
with the ebony-complexioned native of Guinea.&nbsp; Among the
many pictures which Sir Thomas Browne desired to see painted was
&ldquo;a delineation of the Great Fair of Almachara in Arabia,
which, to avoid the great heat of the sun, is kept in the night,
and by the light of the moon.&rdquo;&nbsp; The worthy and learned
knight does not mention the Great Fair of the <i>Hurdwar</i>, in
the northern <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>part of Hindostan, where a confluence
of many millions of human beings is brought together under the
mixed influences of devotion and commercial business, and,
dispersing as rapidly as it has been evoked, the crowd
&ldquo;dislimns and leaves not a wrack behind.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
fairs and general enterprise and opulence are not coeval: neither
do they flourish in an age of iron roads and
steam-carriages.&nbsp; In fact, they were the results of the
inconvenience attendant upon travelling.&nbsp; It was once easier
for goods to come to customers than for customers to leave their
homes in search of goods.&nbsp; Inland trade was heavily crippled
by the badness and insecurity of the highways.&nbsp; The
carriages in which produce was conveyed were necessarily massive
and heavy in their structure, to enable them to resist the
roughness of the ways.&nbsp; Sometimes they were engulfed in
bogs, sometimes upset in dykes, and generally they rolled heavily
along tracks little less uneven than the roofs of houses.</p>
<p>As a direct result of these obstacles to speedy locomotion,
the fruits of the earth, in the winter months, when the roads
were broken up or flooded, were consumed by damp and worms in one
place, while a few miles further on they might have been disposed
of at high prices.&nbsp; Turf was burned in the stoves of London,
long after coals were in daily use in the northern counties; and
petitions were presented to the Houses of Parliament in the reign
of Henry VIII., deprecating the destruction of growing <!-- page
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>timber for the supply of hearth-fuel.&nbsp; Nor were
these miry and uneven ways by any means exempt from toll; on the
contrary, the chivalry of the Cambrian Rebecca might have been
laudably exercised in clearing the thoroughfares of these
unconscionable barriers.&nbsp; It was a costly day&rsquo;s
journey to ride through the domain of a lord abbot or an acred
baron.&nbsp; The bridge, the ferry, the hostelry, the causeway
across the marshes, had each its several perquisite.&nbsp;
Exportation from abroad was oftener cheaper than production at
home.&nbsp; It answered better to import cloth from Flanders than
to weave and bring it from York: and land carriage from Norwich
to London was nearly as burdensome as water-carriage from
Lisbon.&nbsp; Coals, manure, grain, minerals, and leather were
transported on the backs of cattle.&nbsp; An ambassador going or
returning from abroad was followed by as numerous a retinue as if
he had ridden forth conquering and to conquer.&nbsp; Nor were his
followers merely for state or ceremony, but indispensable to his
comfort, since the horses and mules which bore his suite carried
also the furniture of his bed-room and kitchen, owing to the
clumsiness of wheel-carriages.&nbsp; If, as was sometimes the
case, a great lord carried half an estate on his back, he often
consumed the other half in equipping and feeding his train: and
among the pleasures utterly unknown to the world for more than
five thousand years is, that both peer and peasant may now travel
from Middlesex to any <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>portion of the known world with only
an umbrella and carpet-bag.</p>
<p>We have alluded in our sketch of the earliest roads to the
general character of early travelling; but a few words in
connection with roads remain to be said on that subject.&nbsp;
Travelling for pleasure&mdash;taking what our grandfathers were
wont to call the <i>Grand Tour</i>&mdash;were recreations almost
unknown to the ancient world.&nbsp; If Plato went into Egypt, it
was not to ascend the Nile, nor to study the monumental pictures
of a land whose history was graven on rocks, but to hold close
colloquy on metaphysics or divinity with the Dean and Chapter at
Memphis.&nbsp; The Greeks indeed, fortunately for posterity, had
an incredible itch for Egyptian yarns, and no sooner had King
Psammetichus given them a general invitation to the Delta, than
they flocked thither from Athens and Smyrna, and Cos and Sparta,
and the parts of Italy about Thurium, with their heads full of
very particular questions, and often, to judge by their reports
of what they heard, with ears particularly open to any answers
the Egyptian clergy might please to give.&nbsp; Yet pleasure was
not the object of their journey.&nbsp; Science, as themselves
said, curiosity, as their enemies alleged, was the motive for
their encountering perils by land and water.&nbsp; Indeed we
recollect only three travellers, either among the Greeks or
Romans, who can properly be considered as journeying for
pleasure.&nbsp; These were Herodotus&mdash;the prince of <!--
page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>tourists, past, present, or to come,&mdash;Paullus
&AElig;milius, and C&aelig;sar Germanicus.</p>
<p>Herodotus, there is reason to suspect, did not himself
penetrate far into Asia, but gathered many of his stories from
the merchants and mariners who frequented the wine-shops of
Ephesus and Smyrna.&nbsp; Considering the sources of his
information, and the license of invention accorded to travellers
in all ages, the Halicarnassian was reasonably sceptical: and
generally warns his readers when he is going to tell them
&ldquo;a bouncer,&rdquo; by the words &ldquo;so at least they
told me,&rdquo; or &ldquo;so the story goes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Paullus
&AElig;milius travelled like a modern antiquary and
connoisseur.&nbsp; And for beholding the master-pieces of Grecian
art in their original splendour and in their proper local
habitations, never had tourist better opportunities.&nbsp; A
negotiation was pending between the Ach&aelig;an League and the
Roman Commonwealth; and since the preliminaries were rather dull,
and Flaminius felt himself bored by the doubts and ceremonies of
the delegates, he left them in the lurch to draw up their treaty,
and took a holiday tour himself in the Peloponnesus.&nbsp; At
that time not a single painting, statue, or bas-relief had been
carried off to Italy.&nbsp; The Roman villas were decorated with
the designs of Etrurian artists alone, or, at the most, had
imported their sculpture and picture galleries from Thurii and
Tarentum.&nbsp; Flaminius therefore gazed upon the entire mass of
Hellenic art; and the only thing he, unfortunately <!-- page
45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>for
us, neglected, was to keep a journal, and provide for its being
handed down to posterity.</p>
<p>Germanicus, who had beheld many of these marvels in the Forum
and Palaces of Rome&mdash;for the Roman generals resembled the
late Marshal Soult in the talent of appropriating what they
admired&mdash;reserved his curiosity for Egypt alone, and
traversed from Alexandria to Syene the entire valley of the Nile,
listening complacently to all the legends which the priests
deemed fitting to rehearse to Roman ears.&nbsp; He was of course
treated with marked attention.&nbsp; Memnon&rsquo;s statue
sounded its loudest chord at the first touch of the morning ray;
the priests, in their ceremonial habiliments, read to him the
inscriptions on the walls of the great Temple at Carnac&mdash;and
proved to him that after all the Roman empire was no &ldquo;great
shakes;&rdquo; since a thousand years before, Rameses III. had
led more nations behind his chariot, and exacted heavier tributes
of corn, wine, and oil from all who dwelt between the White Nile
and the Caspian Sea.&nbsp; His journey however was so
unprecedented a step, that it brought him into trouble with
Tiberius.&nbsp; The Emperor was half afraid that Germanicus had
some designs upon the kingdom of Egypt, and as that land happened
to be the granary of Rome, the jealous autocrat thought of the
possibility of short-commons and a bread-riot in the Forum.&nbsp;
But even if the tourist had no ulterior views, the Emperor
thought that it did not look like business for a <!-- page
46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>proconsul to be making holiday without leave,&mdash;and
he accordingly reprimanded his adopted son by letter, and scolded
him in a speech to the senate.&nbsp; In our days the Emperor of
Russia would look equally black on a field-marshal who should
come without license to London for the season; and the Mandarin,
who lately exhibited himself in the Chinese Junk, would do well
for the future to eschew the Celestial Empire and its ports and
harbours entirely,&mdash;at least if he have as much
consideration for his personal comfort, as his sleek appearance
indicated.</p>
<p>The Emperor Hadrian might have been added to the list of
ancient travellers in search of the picturesque, both because he
visited nearly every province of his empire, and because he
expended good round sums wherever he went, in restoring,
re-edifying, or beautifying the public edifices which the
provincials had suffered to fall into decay.&nbsp; But
Hadrian&rsquo;s journeys were primarily journeys of business; he
wished, like the Czar Nicholas, to see with his own eyes how
matters went on, and at times he had the felicity of catching a
prefect in the very act of filling his pockets and squeezing the
provincials: we cannot therefore put him to the account of those
who journeyed for pleasure.&nbsp; Every Roman who took any part
in public affairs was, in fact, a great traveller.&nbsp; If he
served his sixteen or twenty years in the legions, and was not
enrolled in the household troops, he was singularly unlucky <!--
page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>if his company were not quartered in Asia, Africa, and
the Danubian provinces.&nbsp; If he became pr&aelig;tor or
consul, a provincial government awaited him at the close of his
year of office; and it depended upon the billets drawn in the
Senate, whether he spent a year or two on the shores of the
Atlantic, or whether he kept staghounds on the frontiers of
Dacia.&nbsp; Nearly every Roman indeed had qualified himself
before he was fifty to be a candidate for the Travellers&rsquo;
Club; and sometimes the fine gentleman, who declined taking an
active part in public affairs, found himself unexpectedly a
thousand miles from home, with an imperial rescript in his
portmanteau enjoining him not to return to Rome without special
leave.</p>
<p>To such a compulsory journey was the poet Ovid condemned,
apparently for his very particular attentions to the Princess
Julia.&nbsp; His exile was a piece of ingenious cruelty.&nbsp; He
was sent to Tomi, which was far beyond the range of all
fashionable bathing-places.&nbsp; The climate was atrocious; the
neighbourhood was worse; the wine was execrable and was often
hard frozen, and eaten like a lozenge, and his only society was
that of the barracks, or a few rich but unpolished corn-factors,
who speculated in grain and deals on the shores of the
Euxine.&nbsp; To write verses from morn to dewy eve was the
unfortunate poet&rsquo;s only solace: and he sent so many reams
of elegies to Rome, that his friends came at last to vote him a
bore, <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>and he was reduced, for want of
fitting audience, to learn the Getic language, and read his
lacrymose couplets to circles of gaping barbarians.</p>
<p>A few of our readers may remember the family coach in which
county magnates rode in procession to church, to Quarter
sessions, and on all occasions of ceremony and parade.&nbsp; The
Landau, so fast disappearing from our streets and roads, was but
a puny bantling of a vehicle in comparison with the older and
more august conveyance.&nbsp; As the gentlemen rode on horseback,
and the ladies upon pillions, on all but the great epochs of
their lives, this wheeled mammoth was rarely drawn out of its
cavern, the coach-house.&nbsp; For not even when in full dress,
raised from the ground by red-heeled shoes resembling a Greek
<i>cothurnus</i>, and with a cubit added to their stature by a
mural battlement of hair, did the ladies of the eighteenth
century disdain to jog soberly behind a booted butler with
pistols in his holsters, and a Sir Cloudesley Shovel beaver on
his head. <a name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48"
class="citation">[48]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;We have heard an <!-- page
49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>ancient matron tell of her riding nine miles to dinner
behind a portly farm bailiff, and with her hair dressed like that
of Madame de Maintenon, which, being interpreted, means that the
locks with which nature had supplied her were further aggravated
by being drawn tight over a leathern cushion&mdash;a fashion
which Jonathan Oldbuck denounces as &ldquo;fit only for Mahound
or Termagaunt.&rdquo;&nbsp; The production of the coach was
therefore the sign of a white or black day in the family
calendar&mdash;inasmuch as it indicated either marriage or
funeral, the approach of the Royal Judges or the execution of a
state prisoner, the drawing for the militia, or a county address
to both Houses of Parliament on the crying grievance of the
Excise.&nbsp; It doubtless took some days to prepare the
imperator&rsquo;s <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>chariot for a Roman triumph: it must
have employed nearly as many to clean and furbish the capacious
body of the modern vehicle.&nbsp; There was moreover a whole
armoury of harness to mend and polish; and as the six long-tailed
Flemish horses were not often in the traces together, some time
was required by them to unlearn the rustic habits of the
farm-yard, and to regain the stately trot at which, where the
roads would admit of it, they ordinarily proceeded.&nbsp; The
following description of a journey to London by an M.P. of 1699
will convey to the reader a lively yet tolerably exact conception
both of the glory and inconveniences of travelling in those
days.&nbsp; It is taken from Vanbrugh&rsquo;s comedy of the
&lsquo;Journey to London,&rsquo; better known in its modern form
of &lsquo;The Provoked Husband.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>James</i>.&nbsp; Sir, Sir, do you hear
the news?&nbsp; They are all a-coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Uncle Richard</i>.&nbsp; Ay, Sirrah, I hear it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>James</i>.&nbsp; Sir, here&rsquo;s John Moody
arrived already: he&rsquo;s stumping about the streets in his
dirty boots, and asking every man he meets, if they can tell him
where he may have a good lodging for a parliament-man, till he
can hire such a house as becomes him.&nbsp; He tells them his
lady and all the family are coming too; and that they are so
nobly attended, they care not a fig for anybody.&nbsp; Sir, they
have added two cart-horses to the four old geldings, because my
lady will have it said she <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>came to town
in a coach and six&mdash;heavy George the ploughman rides
postilion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>U. Richard</i>.&nbsp; Very well, the journey begins
as it should do.&nbsp; Dost know whether they bring all the
children with them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>James</i>.&nbsp; Only Squire Humphrey and Miss
Betty, Sir; the other six are put to board at half-a-crown a week
a head, with Joan Growse at Smoke-dunghill-farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>U. Richard</i>.&nbsp; The Lord have mercy upon all
good folks!&nbsp; What work will these people make!&nbsp; Dost
know when they&rsquo;ll be here?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>James</i>.&nbsp; John says, Sir, they&rsquo;d have
been here last night, but that the old wheezy-belly horse tired,
and the two fore-wheels came crash down at once in Waggon-rut
Lane.&nbsp; Sir, they were cruelly loaden, as I understand: my
lady herself, he says, laid on four mail trunks, besides the
great deal-box, which fat Tom sat upon behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>U. Richard</i>.&nbsp; So!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>James</i>.&nbsp; Then, within the coach there was
Sir Francis, my lady, the great fat lap-dog, Squire Humphrey,
Miss Betty, my lady&rsquo;s maid, Mrs. Handy, and Doll Tripe the
cook; but she puked with sitting backwards, so they mounted her
into the coach-box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>U. Richard</i>.&nbsp; Very well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>James</i>.&nbsp; Then, Sir, for fear of a famine
before they should get to the baiting-place, there was such
baskets of plum-cake, Dutch gingerbread, Cheshire <!-- page
52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>cheese, Naples biscuits, maccaroons, neats&rsquo;
tongues and cold boiled beef; and in case of sickness, such
bottles of usquebaugh, black-cherry brandy, cinnamon-water, sack,
tent, and strong beer, as made the old coach crack again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>U. Richard</i>.&nbsp; Well said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>James</i>.&nbsp; And for defence of this good cheer
and my lady&rsquo;s little pearl necklace, there was the family
basket-hilt sword, the great Turkish scimitar, the old
blunderbuss, a good bag of bullets, and a great horn of
gunpowder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>U. Richard</i>.&nbsp; Admirable!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>James</i>.&nbsp; Then for bandboxes, they were so
bepiled up&mdash;to Sir Francis&rsquo;s nose, that he could only
peep out at a chance hole with one eye, as if he were viewing the
country through a perspective-glass.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;blunderbuss, Turkish scimitar, and basket-hilt
sword,&rdquo; in the foregoing extract from Vanbrugh, point to
one of the constant perils of the road&mdash;the
highwaymen.&nbsp; Lady Wronghead was lucky in bringing her
&ldquo;little pearl necklace&rdquo; safe to London.&nbsp;
Turpin&rsquo;s scouts, a few years later, would have obtained
more accurate information of the rich moveables packed in the
squire&rsquo;s coach.&nbsp; But as yet Turpin and Bradshaw were
not.&nbsp; The great road from York to London however lay always
under an evil reputation.&nbsp; It was by this line that Jeannie
Deans walked to London, and verified the remark of her sagacious
host, the Boniface <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>of Beverley, that the road would be
clear of thieves when Groby Pool was thatched with
pancakes&mdash;and not till then.&nbsp; The example of Robin Hood
was, for centuries after his death, zealously followed by the
more adventurous spirits of Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, and
Yorkshire; and their enterprising genius was well seconded by the
fine breed of horses for which those counties were famous.&nbsp;
For cross-country work the Leicestershire blades had no fellows;
and had the Darlington Hunt existed in those days, they would
doubtless have been first a-field in the morning and last on the
road at night.&nbsp; Nor were there any reasons in their dress,
demeanour, or habits, why they should not consort with the best
of the shire either when riding to cover, or celebrating the
triumphs of the day afterward in the squire&rsquo;s hall, or the
ale-house.&nbsp; Some of these redressers of the inequalities of
fortune were of excellent houses,&mdash;younger sons, who having
no profession&mdash;trade would have been disgraceful in their
eyes&mdash;grew weary of an unvarying round of shooting, fishing,
otter-hunting, and badger-baiting, and aspired, like their common
ancestor Nimrod, to be hunters of men.&nbsp; Others had found the
discipline of a regiment unpleasant, or had been unjust serving
men.&nbsp; In short, the road, about a century and a half ago,
was the general refuge of all who, like the recruits that flocked
to King David at Adullam, were in distress or discontented.&nbsp;
Mail-coach drivers and guards travelled armed to the teeth,
booted to <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>the hips, with bandeliers across
their capacious chests, and three-cornered hats which, in
conjunction with their flowing horse-hair wigs, were both sword-
and bullet-proof.&nbsp; Passengers who had any value for their
lives and limbs, when they booked themselves at London for Exeter
or York, provided themselves with cutlasses and blunderbusses,
and kept as sharp look-out from the coach-windows as travellers
in our day are wont to do in the Mexican diligences.&nbsp; We
remember to have seen a print of the year 1769 in which the
driver of the Boston mail is represented in the armed guise of
Sir Hudibras.&nbsp; He carries a horse-pistol in his belt, and a
<i>couteau de chasse</i> slung over his shoulder, while the guard
is accoutred with no less than three pistols and a basket-hilt
sword, besides having a carbine strapped to his seat behind the
coach.&nbsp; Between the coachman&rsquo;s feet is a small keg,
which might indifferently contain &ldquo;genuine Nantz&rdquo; or
gunpowder.&nbsp; One of the &ldquo;insides,&rdquo; an ancient
gentleman in a Ramilies wig, is seen through the capacious window
of the coach affectionately hugging a carbine, and a yeoman on
the roof is at once caressing a bull-dog, and supporting a
bludgeon that might have served Dandie Dinmont himself.&nbsp; Yet
all these precautions, offensive or defensive, were frequently of
no avail: the gentlemen of the road were still better armed, or
more adroit in handling their weapons.&nbsp; Hounslow Heath on
the great western road, and Finchley Common <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>on the great
northern road, were to the wayfarers for many generations nearly
as terrible as the Valley of the Shadow of Death.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Cambridge scholars,&rdquo; says Mr. Macaulay,
&ldquo;trembled when they approached Epping Forest, even in broad
daylight.&nbsp; Seamen who had just been paid off at Chatham were
often compelled to deliver their purses at Gadshill, celebrated
near a hundred years earlier by the greatest of poets as the
scene of the depredations of Poins and Falstaff.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
terrors of one generation become the sources of romance and
amusement to later times.&nbsp; Four hundred years ago we should
have regarded William of Deloraine as an extremely commonplace
and inconvenient personage: he is now much more interesting than
the armour in the Tower, or than a captain or colonel of the
Guards.&nbsp; A century back we should have slept the more
soundly for the knowledge that Jack Sheppard was securely
swinging in chains; but in these piping times of peace his
biography has extracted from the pockets of the public more
shillings than the subject of it himself ever
&lsquo;nabbed&rsquo; on the king&rsquo;s highway.&nbsp; It is
both interesting and instructive to observe how directly the
material improvements of science act upon the moral condition of
the world.&nbsp; As soon as amended roads admitted of more rapid
movement from place to place, the vocation of the highway robber
was at first rendered difficult, and in the end impossible to
exercise on the greater thoroughfares.&nbsp; Fast <!-- page
56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>horse-coaches were the first obstacle.&nbsp; Railways
have became an insuperable impediment to &ldquo;life on the
road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Lamb indited one of his most pleasant essays upon the
&lsquo;Decay of Beggars in the Metropolis.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the
rural districts vagrancy and mendicity still survive, in spite of
constabulary forces and petty sessions.&nbsp; But the mendicity
of the nineteenth century presents a very different spectacle
from the mendicity of the seventeenth.&nbsp; The well-remembered
beggar is no longer the guest of the parish-parson; the
king&rsquo;s bedesmen have totally vanished; no one now
supplicates for alms under a corporation-seal; nor is the
mendicant regarded as second only to the packman as the general
newsmonger of a neighbourhood.&nbsp; Who does not remember the
description of foreign beggars in the &lsquo;Sentimental
Journey&rsquo;?&nbsp; Many of us have witnessed the loathsome
appearance and humorous importunity of Irish mendicants.&nbsp; A
century ago England rivalled both France and Ireland in the
number of its professional beggars.&nbsp; In the days when
travelling was mostly performed on horseback, the foot of the
hills&mdash;the point where the rider drew bridle&mdash;was the
station of the mendicant, and long practice enabled him to
proportion his clamorous petitions to the length of the ascent.
<a name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56"
class="citation">[56]</a>&nbsp; The old soldier in &lsquo;Gil
Blas&rsquo; stood by <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>the wayside with a carbine laid
across two sticks, and solicited, or rather enforced, the alms of
the passer-by, by an appeal to his fears no less than to his
pity.&nbsp; The readers of the old drama will recall to mind the
shifts and devices of the &lsquo;Jovial Beggars;&rsquo;&mdash;how
easily a wooden leg was slipped off and turned into a bludgeon;
how inscrutable were the disguises, and how copious and
expressive the slang, of the mendicant crew.&nbsp; Coleridge has
justly described &lsquo;The Beggar&rsquo;s Bush&rsquo; as one of
the most pleasant of Fletcher&rsquo;s comedies; and if the
Spanish novelists do not greatly belie the roads of their land,
the mendicant levied his tolls on the highways as punctually as
the king himself.&nbsp; Speed in travelling has been as
prejudicial to these merry and unscrupulous gentry as acts
against vagrancy or the policeman&rsquo;s staff.&nbsp; He should
be a sturdy professor of his art who would pour forth his
supplications on a railway platform; and Belisarius himself would
hardly venture to stop a modern carriage for the chance of an
<i>obolus</i>, to be flung from its window.&nbsp; A few of the
craft indeed linger in bye-roads and infest our villages and
streets; but <i>ichabod</i>!&mdash;its <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>glory has
departed; and the most humane or romantic of travellers may
without scruple consign the modern collector of highway alms to
the tender mercies of the next policeman and the reversion of the
treadmill.</p>
<p>The modern highway is seldom in a direct line.&nbsp; A hill, a
ford, or a wood sufficed to render it circuitous.&nbsp; All roads
indeed through hilly countries were originally struck out by
drivers of pack-horses, who, to avoid bogs, chose the upper
ground.&nbsp; Roads were first made the subject of legislation in
England in the sixteenth century: until then, they had been made
at will and repaired at pleasure.&nbsp; A similar neglect of
uniformity may be seen in Hungary and in Eastern Europe
generally, even in the present day.&nbsp; The roads are made by
each county, and as it depends in great measure upon the caprice
or convenience of the particular proprietors or townships whether
there shall be a road at all, or whether it shall be at all
better than a drift-way or a bridle-track, it often happens that
after bowling along for a score of miles upon a highway worthy of
Macadam, the carriage of the traveller plunges into wet turf or
heavy sand, merely because it has entered upon the boundary of a
new county.&nbsp; Nay, even where the roads have been hitherto
good, it often happens that the new Vicegespann, or Sheriff, a
personage on whose character a good deal depends in county
business, allows them to go to ruin for want of seasonable
repairs.&nbsp; A similar <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>irregularity
was, in our own country, put a stop to in the reign of Mary, when
it was enacted that each parish should maintain its own
roads.&nbsp; A custom was borrowed from the feudal system: the
lord of the manor was empowered to demand from his vassals
certain portions of their labour, including the use of such rude
implements as were then in use.&nbsp; The peasant was bound by
the tenure of his holding, to aid in cutting, carting, and
housing his lord&rsquo;s hay and corn, to repair his bridges, and
to mend his roads.&nbsp; A portion of such services was, in the
sixteenth century, transferred from the lord to the parish or the
district; and the charges of repairing the highways and bridges
fell upon the copyholder.&nbsp; He was compelled to give his
labour for six days in the year, and his work was apportioned and
examined by a surveyor.&nbsp; If this compulsory labour did not
suffice, hired labour was defrayed by a parochial rate: and
although the obligation is seldom enforced, yet it survives in
letter in the majority of the court-rolls of our manors.</p>
<p>So entirely indeed was speed in travelling regarded by our
ancestors as of secondary importance to safety and convenience,
that even in journeying by a public coach the length of a
day&rsquo;s journey was often determined by the vote of the
passengers.&nbsp; The better or worse accommodation of the
roadside inns was taken into account; and it was &ldquo;mine
host&rsquo;s&rdquo; interest to furnish good ale and <!-- page
60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>beef,
since he was tolerably certain that, with such attractions
within-doors, the populous and heavy-laden mail would not pass by
the sign of the Angel or the Griffin.&nbsp; Long and ceremonious
generally were the meals of our forefathers; nor did they abate
one jot from their courtesies when travelling on &ldquo;urgent
business.&rdquo;&nbsp; On arriving at the morning or noontide
baiting-place, and after mustering in the common room of the inn,
the first thing to be done was to appoint a chairman, who mostly
retained his post of honour during the journey.&nbsp; At the
breakfast or dinner there was none of that indecorous hurry in
eating and drinking which marks our degenerate days.&nbsp; Had
the travellers affected such thin potations as tea and soup,
there was ample time for them to cool.&nbsp; But they preferred
the sirloin and the tankard; and that no feature of a generous
reception might be wanting, the landlord would not fail to
recommend his crowning cup of sack or claret.&nbsp; The coachman,
who might now and then feel some anxiety to proceed, would yet
merely admonish his fare that the day was wearing on; but his
scruples would vanish before a grace-cup, and he would even
connive at a proposal to take a pipe of tobacco, before the horn
was permitted to summon the passengers to resume their
places.&nbsp; Hence the great caution observable in the newspaper
advertisements of coach-travelling.&nbsp; We have now before us
an announcement of the kind, dated in the year 1751.&nbsp; It
sets <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>forth that, God willing, the new Expedition coach! will
leave the Maid&rsquo;s Head, Norwich, on Wednesday or Thursday
morning, at seven o&rsquo;clock, and arrive at the Boar in
Aldgate on the Friday or Saturday, &ldquo;as shall seem
good&rdquo; to the majority of the passengers.&nbsp; It appears
from the appellation of the vehicle, &ldquo;the new
Expedition,&rdquo; that such a rate of journeying was considered
to be an advance in speed, and an innovation worthy of general
notice and patronage.&nbsp; Fifty years before the same journey
had occupied a week; and in 1664 Christopher Milton, the
poet&rsquo;s brother, and afterwards one of King James
II.&rsquo;s justices, had taken eight-and-forty hours to go from
the <i>Belle Sauvage</i> to Ipswich!&nbsp; At the same period the
stage-coach which ran between London and Oxford required two days
for a journey which is now performed in about two hours on the
Great Western line.&nbsp; The stage to Exeter occupied four
days.&nbsp; In 1703, when Prince George of Denmark visited the
stately mansion of Petworth, with the view of meeting Charles
III. of Spain, the last nine miles of the journey took six
hours.&nbsp; Several of the carriages employed to convey his
retinue were upset or otherwise injured; and an unlucky courier
in attendance complains that during fourteen hours he never once
alighted, except when the coach overturned or was stuck in the
mud.</p>
<p>Direction-posts in the seventeenth century were almost
unknown.&nbsp; Thoresby of Leeds, the well-known <!-- page
62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>antiquary, relates in his Diary, that he had well-nigh
lost his way on the great north road, one of the best in the
kingdom, and that he actually lost himself between Doncaster and
York.&nbsp; Pepys, travelling with his wife in his own carriage,
lost his way twice in one short hour, and on the second occasion
narrowly escaped passing a comfortless night on Salisbury
Plain.&nbsp; So late indeed as the year 1770 no material
improvement had been effected in road-making.&nbsp; The highways
of Lancashire, the county which gave to the world the earliest
important railroad, were peculiarly infamous.&nbsp; Within the
space of eighteen miles a traveller passed three carts broken
down by ruts four feet deep, that even in summer floated with
mud, and which were mended with large loose stones shot down at
random by the surveyors.&nbsp; So dangerous were the Lancashire
thoroughfares that one writer of the time charges all travellers
to shun them as they would the devil, &ldquo;for a thousand to
one they break their necks or their limbs by overthrows or
breaking down.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the winter season stage-coaches
were laid up like so many ships during Arctic frosts, since it
was impossible for any number of horses to drag them through the
intervening impediments, or for any strength of wheel or perch to
resist the rugged and precipitous inequalities of the
roads.&nbsp; &ldquo;For all practical purposes,&rdquo; as Mr.
Macaulay remarks, &ldquo;the inhabitants of London were further
from Reading than <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>they are now from Edinburgh, and
further from Edinburgh than they are now from Vienna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>France generally is still far behind Britain in all the
appurtenances of swift and easy travelling.&nbsp; In the
eighteenth century it was relatively at par with this
country.&nbsp; The following misadventures of Voltaire and two
female companions, when on an excursion from Paris to the
provinces, are thus sketched by the pen of Thomas
Carlyle:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Figure a lean and vivid-tempered
philosopher starting from Paris, under cloud of night, during
hard frost, in a large lumbering coach, or rather waggon,
compared with which indeed the generality of modern waggons were
a luxurious conveyance.&nbsp; With four starved and perhaps
spavined hacks, he slowly sets forth under a mountain of
bandboxes.&nbsp; At his side sits the wandering virago, Marquise
du Ch&acirc;telet, in front of him a serving maid, with
additional bandboxes, <i>et divers effets de sa
ma&icirc;tresse</i>.&nbsp; At the next stage the postilions have
to be beat up: they came out swearing.&nbsp; Cloaks and
fur-pelisses avail little against the January cold; &lsquo;time
and hours&rsquo; are the only hope.&nbsp; But lo! at the tenth
mile, this Tyburn coach breaks down.&nbsp; One many-voiced
discordant wail shrieks through the solitude, making night
hideous&mdash;but in vain: the axle-tree has given way; the
vehicle has overset, and marchionesses, chamber-maids, bandboxes,
and philosophers are weltering in inextricable chaos.&nbsp; The
carriage was in the stage next <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>Nangis, about
half-way to that town, when the hind axle-tree broke, and it
tumbled on the road to M. de Voltaire&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; Madame
du Ch&acirc;telet and her maid fell above him, with all their
bundles and bandboxes, for these were not tied to the front but
only piled up on both hands of the maid; and so, observing the
law of gravitation and equilibrium of bodies, they rushed toward
the corner where M. de Voltaire lay squeezed together.&nbsp;
Under so many burdens, which half-suffocated him, he kept
shouting bitterly; but it was impossible to change place; all had
to remain as it was till the two lackeys, one of whom was hurt by
the fall, could come up, with the postilions, to disencumber the
vehicle; they first drew out all the luggage, next the women, and
then M. de Voltaire.&nbsp; Nothing could be got out except by the
top, that is, by the coach-door, which now opened upwards.&nbsp;
One of the lackeys and a postilion, clambering aloft and fixing
themselves on the body of the vehicle, drew them up as from a
well, seizing the first limb that came to hand, whether arm or
leg, and then passed them down to the two stationed below, who
set them firmly on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was not entirely for state or distinction of ranks that
noblemen of yore were attended on their journeys by running
footmen.&nbsp; A few supernumerary hands were needed in case of
accidents on the road.&nbsp; A box of carpenters&rsquo; tools
formed an indispensable part of the baggage, and the <!-- page
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>accompanying lackeys were skilful in handling them, as
well as in replacing the cast shoes of the horses, for many
districts would not afford a Wayland Smith.&nbsp; The state of
travelling was doubtless increased by these &lsquo;cursive
appendages, bearing white wands, and decked in the gay liveries
of the house which they served.&nbsp; In the &lsquo;Bride of
Lammermoor&rsquo; we have a graphic picture of these pedestrian
accompaniments of the coaches of &ldquo;Persons of
Quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The privilege of nobility in those days,&rdquo; says
Sir Walter Scott, &ldquo;had something in it impressive on the
imagination: the dresses and liveries, and number of their
attendants, their style of travelling, the imposing and almost
warlike air of the armed men who surrounded them, placed them far
above the laird who travelled with his brace of footmen; and as
to rivalry from the mercantile part of the community, these would
as soon have thought of imitating the state and equipage of the
Sovereign. . . . Two running footmen, dressed in white, with
black jockey caps, and long staves in their hands, headed the
train; and such was their agility that they found no difficulty
in keeping the necessary advance which the etiquette of their
station required before the carriage and horsemen.&nbsp; Onward
they came at an easy swinging trot, arguing unwearied speed in
their long-breathed calling.&nbsp; Behind these glowing meteors,
who footed it as if the avenger of blood had been behind them,
<!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>came a cloud of dust, raised by riders who preceded,
attended, or followed, the state-carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In times when persons of quality journeyed in this stately and
sumptuous fashion, it was often needful to mend the roads
specially on their account.&nbsp; The approach of a Royal
Progress, or the Lord Lieutenant of the county, was a signal for
a general &lsquo;turn-out&rsquo; of labourers and masons to lay
gravel over the most suspicious places, and to render the bridges
at least temporarily secure.&nbsp; Scarcely a Quarter sessions in
the seventeenth century passed over without presentments from the
Grand Jury against certain districts of the county; and few and
favoured were the districts which escaped a good round fine from
the Judges, as a set-off against the bruises and other damages
which their Lordships sustained on their circuit.&nbsp; It was no
unusual accident for the Court to be kept waiting many hours for
the arrival of the Judge.&nbsp; Either his Lordship had been dug
out of a bog, or his official wardrobe had been carried away by a
bridgeless stream.&nbsp; Often, too, the patience of jurors was
severely tried by the non-appearance of counsel.&nbsp; These
inconveniences became more apparent after it had ceased to be the
fashion for the Judges and the Bar to travel on horseback from
one assize-town to another.&nbsp; Cowper, writing to his
pedestrian friend Rose, playfully imagines that when he should
attain to the dignity of the ermine, he would institute the
practice of &lsquo;walking&rsquo; <!-- page 67--><a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>the
circuit.&nbsp; But equestrian circuits were long in use, and the
Bar turned out as if their chase had been deer instead of John
Doe and Richard Roe.&nbsp; When however it came to be thought
indecorous for a Judge to wear jack-boots, the danger of
wheel-carriages was sensibly felt by the luminaries of the law,
and the periodical journeys of the votaries of Themis tended
directly to the correction of ways as well as to the suppression
of vice.&nbsp; A zealous High Sheriff or a loyal Lord Lieutenant
would sometimes contribute out of his private purse to the
security of the Bench: and the more enterprising towns began to
think it concerned their honour that the delegates of Majesty
should reach their gates scatheless and unwearied by the toils of
the road.</p>
<p>But road-making entrusted to the separate discretion of
parochial authorities was often performed in a slovenly, and
always in an unsystematic, manner.&nbsp; In adopting a direct or
a circuitous line of way innumerable predilections interfered,
and parishes not rarely indulged in acrimonious controversies,
especially when the time came for walking the boundaries.&nbsp;
The dispute between broad and narrow gauges is indeed merely a
modern form of a long-standing quarrel.&nbsp; A market-town and a
seaport would naturally desire to have ample verge and room
enough on their highways for the transport of grain, hides, and
timber from the interior, and for carriage of cloth and
manufactured <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>or imported goods to the
inland.&nbsp; On the other hand isolated parishes would contend
that driftways were all-sufficient for their demands, and that
they could house their crops or bring their flour from the mill
through the same ruts which had served their forefathers.&nbsp;
But in Charles II.&rsquo;s reign, after the civil wars had given
an impetus to the public mind, and while, although our foreign
policy was disgraceful, and each cabinet more indecorous than its
predecessor, the country at large was steadily advancing in
prosperity, this lack of uniformity was acknowledged to be no
longer tolerable.&nbsp; Compulsory labour and parochial rates, or
hired labour and occasional outlays, were found alike
insufficient to ensure good roads.&nbsp; An act was accordingly
passed authorizing a small toll to pay the needful
expenses.&nbsp; The turnpike-gate to which we are accustomed was
originally a bar supported on two posts on the opposite sides of
the road, and the collector sat, <i>sub dio</i>, at his seat of
customs.&nbsp; It was long however before the advantages of this
plan were acknowledged by the people.&nbsp; Riots, resembling the
Rebecca riots, were of frequent occurrence in the less-frequented
counties: the road-surveyor was as odious as the collector of the
chimney-tax; the toll-bar was seen blazing at night; its guardian
deemed himself fortunate to escape with a few kicks; and it was
not until a much later day that a public or private coach could
trundle along the roads without encountering deep <!-- page
69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>and
dislocating ruts, or rocking over a surface of unbroken
stones.&nbsp; Frost and rain were more effective than the duly
appointed surveyor in breaking up these rude materials, and
reducing the surface to something resembling a level.</p>
<p>A few years since some of the most strenuous opponents of
railways were to be found among the squirearchy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; argued these rural magnates, &ldquo;should our
woods be levelled and our corn-lands bisected, our game scared
away and our parks disfigured by noise and smoke, to suit the
convenience of the dingy denizens of Manchester, or the
purse-proud merchants of Liverpool?&rdquo;&nbsp; Similar
arguments were urged not more than a century ago against the
formation of new turnpike roads.&nbsp; The bittern, it was said,
would be driven from his pool, the fox from his earth, the wild
fowl would be frightened away from the marshes, and many a fine
haunch of venison would be sent to London markets without the
proper ceremonies of turning off and running down the buck.&nbsp;
Merrie England could not exist without miry roads.&nbsp; In 1760
there was no turnpike road between the port of Lynn and the great
corn and cattle market at Norwich.&nbsp; In 1762 an opulent
gentleman, who had resided for a generation of mortal life in
Lisbon, was desirous to revisit his paternal home among the meres
of the eastern counties.&nbsp; His wish was further stimulated by
the circumstance that his sister and sole surviving relative
dwelt beside one of the <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>great Broads, which, in these
regions, penetrate far inland from the sea-coast.&nbsp; From
London to the capital town of his native county his way was
tolerably smooth and prosperous.&nbsp; The distance was about a
hundred and ten miles, and by the aid of a mail coach he
performed the journey in three days.&nbsp; But now commenced his
real labours.&nbsp; Between his sister&rsquo;s dwelling and the
provincial capital lay some twenty miles of alternate ridges of
gravel and morass.&nbsp; Had he been a young man he might have
walked safely and speedily under the guidance of some frugal
swain or tripping dairymaid returning from market.&nbsp; Had he
been a wise man he would have hired a nag, and trotted soberly
along such bridle-roads as he found.&nbsp; But he was neither a
young nor a wise man.&nbsp; His better years had been passed in
the counting-houses of Santarem, and his bodily activity was
impaired by long and copious infusions of generous old
port.&nbsp; So, as he could neither walk nor ride, he deposited
his portly and withal somewhat gouty person in a coach-and-six,
and set forth upon his fraternal quest.&nbsp; He had little
reason to plume himself upon the pomp and circumstance of his
equipage.&nbsp; The six hired coach-horses, albeit of the strong
Flanders breed, were in a few hours engulfed in a black pool; his
coach, or rather his travelling mansion, was inextricably sunk in
the same slimy hollow; and the merchant himself, whose journeys
had hitherto been made on the sober back of a <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Lusitanian
mule, was ignominiously dragged by two cowherds through his
coach-windows,&mdash;and mounted on one of the wheelers, he was
brought back, drenched and weary, to the place whence he set
out.&nbsp; In high dudgeon, the purveyor of Bacchus returned to
London, and could never be induced to resume the search of his
&ldquo;Anna soror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such imperfect means of transit materially affected both the
manners and the intelligence of the age.&nbsp; Postal
arrangements indeed existed, but of the rudest kind.&nbsp; It was
common for letters to be left at the principal inns on the main
road, to be delivered when called for.&nbsp; They remained often
in the bar until the address was illegible, or smoke had dyed the
paper a saffron-yellow.&nbsp; Special announcements of deaths and
births or urgent business were necessarily entrusted to special
messengers; and the title and superscription of these
privately-sent letters generally contain very minute and even
peremptory injunctions of a certain and swift delivery.&nbsp; But
for such cautions, a rich uncle might have been quietly inurned
without his expectant nephews hearing of his decease; and a whole
college kept waiting, till the year of grace had passed, for the
news of a fat rector&rsquo;s much-desired apoplexy.&nbsp; The
death of good Queen Bess was not known in some of the remoter
parishes of Devonshire until the courtiers of James had ceased to
wear mourning for her.&nbsp; The Hebrews of York heard with
quivering lips and ashen brows of the <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>massacre of
their people in London at Richard I.&rsquo;s coronation, six
weeks after it was perpetrated; and the churches of the Orkneys
put up prayers for King James three months after the abdicated
monarch had fled to St. Germain&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There was in
nearly all rural districts the king of London and the king of the
immediate neighbourhood.&nbsp; The Walpoles and Townshends in
their own domains were far more formidable personages than George
I.; and at a time when the King of Prussia&rsquo;s picture was
commonly hung out at ale-house doors as an incitement to try the
ale, <a name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a> an ancient dame near Doncaster
exclaimed, on being informed of his majesty&rsquo;s decease,
&ldquo;Lord a&rsquo; mercy, is he! and, pray, who is to be the
new Lord Mayor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A considerable improvement in the roads of Great Britain took
place in the latter half of the preceding century.&nbsp; This
change was partly owing <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>to the advancing civilization of the
larger towns and cities, and partly to the march of the
Highlanders into England under Prince Charles Edward, in
1745.&nbsp; At that period communication was so imperfect that
the Pretender had advanced a hundred miles from Edinburgh without
exciting any peculiar alarm in the midland or southern counties,
while in the metropolis itself no certain information could be
obtained of the movements of the rebel army for some days after
their departure southward.&nbsp; The Duke of Cumberland&rsquo;s
march northward was much impeded by the difficulty of
transporting his park of artillery.&nbsp; But after the decisive
day of Culloden, the erection of Fort William, and the
establishment of military posts at the foot of the Grampians, the
expediency of readier communication between the capitals of South
and North Britain was universally felt.&nbsp; Scotland could
henceforward be held in permanent subordination only by means of
good military highways.&nbsp; Accordingly in the year 1782 we
find a German traveller (Moritz) speaking of the roads in the
neighbourhood of London as &ldquo;incomparable.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
is astonished &ldquo;how they got them so firm and solid;&rdquo;
and he thus describes his stage of sixteen miles from Dartford,
the place of his disembarkation, to the metropolis:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our little party now separated and got into
two post-chaises, each of which held three persons, though it
must be owned that three cannot sit quite so commodiously in
these chaises as two; the <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>hire of a
post-chaise is a shilling for every English mile.&nbsp; They may
be compared to our extra-posts, because they are to be had at all
times.&nbsp; But these carriages are very neat and lightly built,
so that you hardly perceive their motion, as they roll along
these firm smooth roads; they have windows in front and on both
sides; the horses are generally good, and the postilions
particularly smart and active, and always ride at a full
trot.&nbsp; The one we had wore his hair cut short, a round hat,
and a brown jacket, of tolerably fine cloth, with a nosegay in
his bosom.&nbsp; Now and then, when he drove very hard, he looked
round, and with a smile seemed to solicit our approbation.&nbsp;
A thousand charming spots and beautiful landscapes, on which my
eye would long have dwelt with rapture, were now rapidly passed
with the speed of an arrow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was one of Samuel Johnson&rsquo;s wishes that he might be
driven rapidly in a post-chaise, with a pretty woman, capable of
understanding his conversation, for his travelling
companion.&nbsp; The smartness of the English postboy was
emulated in France,&mdash;not, as might have been expected, by
his professional brethren, who until very recently retained their
ponderous jackboots, three-cornered hats, and heavy knotted
whips, but by the younger members of <i>la haute
noblesse</i>.&nbsp; To look like an English jockey or postilion,
was long the object of fashionable ambition with Parisian
dandies.&nbsp; &ldquo;Vous me crottez, Monsieur,&rdquo; said poor
patient Louis XVI. to one of <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>these
exquisite centaurs, as he rode beside the royal carriage near
Versailles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oui, Sire, &agrave;
l&rsquo;Anglaise,&rdquo; rejoined the self-satisfied dandy,
understanding his majesty to have complimented his
<i>trotting</i> (<i>trottez</i>), and taking it as a tribute to
the skill of his imitation.</p>
<p>Pedlars and packhorses were a necessary accompaniment of bad
and narrow roads.&nbsp; The latter have long disappeared from our
highways; the former linger in less-frequented districts of the
country, but miserably shorn of their former importance.&nbsp; A
licensed hawker is now a very unromantic personage.&nbsp; His
comings and goings attract no more attention among the rustics or
at the squire&rsquo;s hall than the passing by of a plough or a
sheep.&nbsp; The fixed shop has deprived him of his utility, and
daily newspapers of his attractions.&nbsp; He is content to sell
his waistcoat or handkerchief pieces; but he is no longer the
oracle of the village inn or the housekeeper&rsquo;s room.&nbsp;
In the days however when neither draper&rsquo;s nor
haberdasher&rsquo;s wares could be purchased without taking a
day&rsquo;s journey at the least through miry ways to some
considerable market-town, the pedlar was the merchant and newsman
of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; He was as loquacious as a
barber.&nbsp; He was nearly as ubiquitous as the Wandering
Jew.&nbsp; He had his winter circuit and his summer
circuit.&nbsp; He was as regular in the delivery of news as the
postman; nay, he often forestalled that government <!-- page
76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>official in bringing down the latest intelligence of a
landing on the French coast; of an execution at Tyburn; of a
meteor in the sky; of a strike at Spitalfields; and of prices in
the London markets.&nbsp; He was a favourite with the village
crones, for he brought down with him the latest medicines for
ague, rheumatism, and the evil.&nbsp; He wrote love-letters for
village beauties.&nbsp; He instructed alehouse politicians in the
last speech of Bolingbroke, Walpole, or Pitt.&nbsp; His tea,
which often had paid no duty, emitted a savour and fragrance
unknown to the dried sloe-leaves vended by ordinary
grocers.&nbsp; He was the milliner of rural belles.&nbsp; He was
the purveyor for village songsters, having ever in his pack the
most modern and captivating lace and ribbons, and the newest song
and madrigal.&nbsp; He was competent by his experience to advise
in the adjustment of top-knots and farthingales, and to show
rustic beaux the last cock of the hat and the most approved
method of wielding a cane.&nbsp; He was an oral &lsquo;Belle
Assembl&eacute;e.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was full of &ldquo;quips and
cranks and wreathed smiles.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Indifferent&rsquo; honest, he was not the less welcome for
being a bit of a picaroon.&nbsp; Autolycus, the very type of his
profession,&mdash;and such as the pedlar was in the days of Queen
Bess, such also was he in the days of George II.,&mdash;was
littered under Mercury, and a snapper-up of unconsidered
trifles.&nbsp; His songs would draw three souls out of one
weaver.&nbsp; His pack was furnished with</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>&ldquo;Lawn, as white as driven
snow;<br />
Cyprus, black as e&rsquo;er was crow;<br />
Gloves, as sweet as damask roses,<br />
Masks for faces and for noses;<br />
Bugle-bracelet, necklace amber,<br />
Perfume for a lady&rsquo;s chamber;<br />
Golden quoifs and stomachers<br />
For my lads to give their dears;<br />
Pins and poking-sticks of steel,&mdash;<br />
What maids lack from head to heel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then did he chant after the following fashion, at
&ldquo;holy-ales and festivals&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Will you buy any tape,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or lace for your cape,<br />
My dainty duck, my dear&mdash;a?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Any silk, any thread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Any toys for your head,<br />
Of the new&rsquo;st and fin&rsquo;st, fin&rsquo;st
wear&mdash;a?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come to the pedlar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Money&rsquo;s a meddler,<br />
That doth alter all men&rsquo;s wear&mdash;a!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One accident in pedlar life was some drawback to its general
pleasantness.&nbsp; He often bore not only a great charge of
goods, but of gold also.&nbsp; His steps were dogged by robbers,
and many a skeleton, since disinterred in solitary places, is the
mortal framework of some wandering merchant who had met with foul
play on his circuit.&nbsp; The packman&rsquo;s ghost too is no
unusual spectre in many of our shires.</p>
<p>How important a personage among the <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i> of rural life the pedlar was, at even a recent
period, in the northern counties of England, may <!-- page
78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>be
inferred from Wordsworth&rsquo;s choice of him for the hero of
his &lsquo;Excursion.&rsquo;&nbsp; Much ridicule, and even
obloquy, did the staunch poet of Rydal incur for choosing such a
character, when he might have taken Laras and Conrads by the
score, and been praised for his choice.&nbsp; But &ldquo;the
vagrant merchant under a heavy load,&rdquo; being a portion of
the mountain life which surrounded the poet&rsquo;s home, was
better than any hero of romance for his purpose; and a younger
generation has confirmed the poet&rsquo;s choice of a hero, and
few remain now to mock at the Pedlar.&nbsp; Wordsworth&rsquo;s
pedlar indeed was no Bryce Snailsfoot, nor Donald Bean, nor even
such a one as was first cousin to Andrew Fairservice, but rather,
by virtue of a poetic diploma, a philosopher of the ancient
stamp.&nbsp; For</p>

He wandered far; much did he see of men,<br />
Their manners, their enjoyments and pursuits,<br />
Their passions and their feelings; chiefly those<br />
Essential and eternal in the heart,<br />
That, &rsquo;mid the simpler forms of rural life<br />
Exist more simple in their elements,<br />
And speak a plainer language.&nbsp; In the woods,<br />
A lone enthusiast, and among the fields,<br />
Itinerant in this labour, he had passed<br />
The better portion of his time; and there<br />
Spontaneously had his affections thriven<br />
Amid the bounties of the year, the peace<br />
And liberty of nature; there he kept<br />
In solitude and solitary thought,<br />
His mind in a just equipoise of love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucian, in his vision of Hades, beheld the Shades <!-- page
79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>of
the Dead set by pitiless Minos or Rhadamanthus to perform tasks
most alien to their occupations while they were yet denizens of
earth.&nbsp; Nero, according to Rabelais, who improves on
Lucian&rsquo;s hint, was an angler in the Lake of Darkness;
Alexander the Great a cobbler of shoes; and &ldquo;imperial
C&aelig;sar dead and turned to clay&rdquo; a hawker of petty
wares.&nbsp; It was easier to fit the shadows of monarchs with
employment than it would be to find business for departed
coachmen.&nbsp; &ldquo;A coachman, Sir,&rdquo; said one of these
worthies to ourselves, who was sorrowfully contemplating the
approaching day of his extinction by a nearly completed
railway,&mdash;&ldquo;a coachman, if he really be one, is fit for
nothing else.&nbsp; The hand which has from boyhood&mdash;or
rather horsekeeper-hood&mdash;grasped the reins, cannot close
upon the chisel or the shuttle.&nbsp; He cannot sink into a
book-keeper, for his fingers could as soon handle a lancet as a
pen.&nbsp; His bread is gone when his stable-door is
shut.&rdquo;&nbsp; We attempted to console him by pointing out
that it was a law of nature for certain races of mankind to
become extinct.&nbsp; Were not the Red Men fading away before the
sons of the White Spirit?&nbsp; Was not the Cornish tongue, and
were not the old Cornish manners, for ever lost to earth, on the
day when the old shrewish fishwife, Dolly Pentrath, departed this
life towards the middle of the reign of King George III.?&nbsp;
Seeing these things are so, and that &ldquo;all beneath the moon
doth suffer change,&rdquo; why should <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>coachmen
endure for ever?&nbsp; But our consolation was poured into deaf
ears, and some two years afterwards we recognized our desponding
Jehu under the mournful disfigurements of the driver of a
hearse.&nbsp; The days of pedlars and stage-coachmen have reached
their eve, and look not for restoration.&nbsp; They are waning
into the Hades of extinct races, with the sumpnours and the
limitours of the Canterbury Pilgrims.</p>
<p>We have described some of the difficulties and dangers to
which travellers were subjected in the days of Old Roads.&nbsp;
Yet the ancient Highways were not without their attending
compensations.&nbsp; Pleasant it was to travel in company, as
Chaucer voucheth: pleasant to linger by the way, as Montaigne
testifies.&nbsp; To meditative and imaginative persons there was
delight in sauntering through a fair country, viewing leisurely
its rivers, meadows, hills, and towns.&nbsp; Burton prescribes
travelling among his cures for melancholy, and he would not have
recommended railway speed or even a fast coach to sad and timid
men.&nbsp; His advice presupposed sober progress, gliding down
rivers, patient winding round lofty hills, contemplation by
woodsides and in green meadows, relaxation not tension of nerve
and brain.&nbsp; &ldquo;No better physick,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;for a melancholy man than change of aire and variety of
places, to travel abroad and see fashions.&nbsp; Leo Afer speakes
of many of his countrymen so cured without all other
physick.&nbsp; No man, saith <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>Lipsius, in
an epistle to Phil. Lanoius, a noble friend of his, now ready to
make a voyage, can be such a stock or stone, whom that pleasant
speculation of countries, cities, towns, rivers, will not
affect.&nbsp; For peregrination charms our senses with such
unspeakable and sweet variety, that some count him unhappy that
never travelled, a kinde of prisoner, and pity his case, that
from his cradle to old age beholds the same still; insomuch that
Rhasis doth not only commend but enjoyn travell, and such variety
of objects to a melancholy man, and to lye in diverse innes, to
be drawn into severall companies.&nbsp; A good prospect alone
will ease melancholy, as Gomesius contends.&nbsp; The citizens of
Barcino, saith he, are much delighted with that pleasant prospect
their city hath into the sea, which, like that of old Athens,
besides &AElig;gina, Salamina, and other pleasant islands, had
all the variety of delicious objects; so are those Neapolitanes
and inhabitants of Genua, to see the ships, boats, and passengers
go by, out of their windows, their whole cities being sited on
the side of an hill like Pera by Constantinople.&nbsp; Yet these
are too great a distance: some are especially affected with such
objects as be near, to see passengers go by in some great
road-way or boats in a river, <i>in subjectum forum
despicere</i>, to oversee a fair, a market-place, or out of a
pleasant window into some thoroughfare street to behold a
continual concourse, a promiscuous rout, coming and
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>Indifferent roads and uneasy carriages, riding post, and
dread of highwaymen, darkness or the inclemency of the seasons,
led, as by a direct consequence, to the construction of excellent
inns in our island.&nbsp; The superiority of our English hotels
in the seventeenth century is thus described by the most
picturesque of modern historians:&mdash;&ldquo;From a very early
period,&rdquo; says Mr. Macaulay, &ldquo;the inns of England had
been renowned.&nbsp; Our first great poet had described the
excellent accommodation which they afforded to the pilgrims of
the fourteenth century.&nbsp; Nine and twenty persons, with their
horses, found room in the wide chambers and stables of the
Tabard, in Southwark.&nbsp; The food was of the best, and the
wines such as drew the company to drink largely.&nbsp; Two
hundred years later, under the reign of Elizabeth, William
Harrison gave a lively description of the plenty and comfort of
the great hostelries.&nbsp; The continent of Europe, he said,
could show nothing like them.&nbsp; There were some in which two
or three hundred people, with their horses, could without
difficulty be lodged and fed.&nbsp; The bedding, the tapestry,
above all the abundance of clean and fine linen was matter of
wonder.&nbsp; Valuable plate was often set on the tables.&nbsp;
Nay, there were signs which had cost thirty or forty pounds. <a
name="citation82"></a><a href="#footnote82"
class="citation">[82]</a>&nbsp; In the seventeenth <!-- page
83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>century, England abounded with excellent inns of every
rank.&nbsp; The traveller sometimes in a small village lighted on
a public-house, such as Walton has described, where the brick
floor was swept clean, where the walls were stuck round with
ballads, where the sheets smelt of lavender, and where a blazing
fire, a cup of good ale, and a dish of trout fresh from the
neighbouring brook, were to be procured at small charge.&nbsp; At
the larger houses of entertainment were to be found beds hung
with silk, choice cookery, and claret equal to the best which was
drunk in London.&nbsp; The innkeepers too, it was said, were not
like other innkeepers.&nbsp; On the continent the landlord was
the tyrant of those who crossed his threshold.&nbsp; In England
he was a servant.&nbsp; Never was an Englishman more at home than
when he took his ease in his inn.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Many conveniences which were unknown at
Hampton Court and Whitehall in the seventeenth <!-- page 84--><a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>century, are
to be found in our modern hotels.&nbsp; Yet on the whole it is
certain that the improvement of our houses of public
entertainment has by no means kept pace with the improvement of
our roads and conveyances.&nbsp; Nor is this strange; for it is
evident that, all other circumstances being supposed equal, the
inns will be best where the means of locomotion are worst.&nbsp;
The quicker the rate of travelling, the less important is it that
there should be numerous agreeable resting-places for the
travellers.&nbsp; A hundred and sixty years ago a person who came
up to the capital from a remote county generally required twelve
or fifteen meals, and lodging for five or six nights by the
way.&nbsp; If he were a great man, he expected the meals and
lodging to be comfortable and even luxurious.&nbsp; At present we
fly from York or Chester to London by the light of a single
winter&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; At present therefore a traveller seldom
interrupts his journey merely for the sake of rest and
refreshment.&nbsp; The consequence is that hundreds of excellent
inns have fallen into decay.&nbsp; In a short time no good houses
of that description will be found, except at places where
strangers are likely to be detained by business or
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Highwaymen, pedlars, inns, coachmen, and well-appointed
coaches have now nearly vanished from our roads.&nbsp; Some of
the more excellent breeds of English horses have gone with them,
or will soon follow them.&nbsp; In another generation no <!--
page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>one will survive who has seen a Norfolk hackney.&nbsp;
This race of sure-footed indefatigable trotters has already
become so few in number that &ldquo;a child may count
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The oldest inhabitant&rdquo;&mdash;that
universal referee with some persons on all disputed
points&mdash;never set eye on a genuine Flemish coach-horse in
England; and the gallant high-stepping hybrid&mdash;half
thoroughbred, half hackney&mdash;which whirled along the fast
coaches at the rate of twelve miles in the hour will in a few
years be nowhere found.&nbsp; The art of &lsquo;putting to&rsquo;
four horses in a few seconds will become one of the &lsquo;artes
deperdit&aelig;;&rsquo; and the science of driving so as to
divide equally the weight and the speed between the team, and to
apportion the strength of the cattle to the variations of the
road, will have become a tradition.&nbsp; Perfect as mechanism
was the discipline of a well-trained leader.&nbsp; He knew the
road, and the duty expected of him.&nbsp; Docile and towardly
during his seven- or nine-mile stage, he refused to perform more
than his allotted task.&nbsp; Attached to his yoke-fellow, he
resented the intrusion of a stranger into his harness: and a mere
change of hands on the box would often convert the willing steed
into a recusant against the collar, whom neither soothing nor
severity would induce to budge a step.&nbsp; Some suffering
indeed has been spared to the equine world by the substitution of
brass and iron for blood and sinews; but the poetry of the road
is gone with the <i>quadrig&aelig;</i> <!-- page 86--><a

years ago tripped lightly and proudly over the level of the

<p>Of the old roads of the Continent during the Dark and Middle
Ages, we have little to record.&nbsp; The central energy of Rome
had suffered collapse.&nbsp; Europe was partitioned into feeble
kingdoms and powerful fiefs.&nbsp; War was the normal condition
of its provinces; the sports of the field were unfavourable to
agriculture, and directly opposed to the promotion of commerce
and the growth of towns.&nbsp; So long as it was conducive to the
pleasures of the manorial lord to keep large tracts of land
uncultivated, it was contrary to his interests to form great
thoroughfares.&nbsp; We have in the &lsquo;Tesoretto&rsquo; of
Brunetto a striking picture of the desolation of northern Spain
in the thirteenth century.&nbsp; He thus describes his journey
over the plain of Roncesvalles.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There a scholar I espied,<br />
On a bay mule that did ride.<br />
Well away! what fearful ground<br />
In that savage part I found.<br />
If of art I aught could ken,<br />
Well behoved me use it then.<br />
More I look&rsquo;d, the more I deem&rsquo;d<br />
That it wild and desert seem&rsquo;d:<br />
<!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Not a house and not a wight;<br />
Not a bird and not a brute,<br />
Not a rill, and not a root;<br />
Not an emmet, not a fly,<br />
Not a thing I mote descry:<br />
Sore I doubted therewithal<br />
Whether death would me befall.<br />
Nor was wonder, for around<br />
Full three hundred miles of ground,<br />
Right across on every side<br />
Lay the desert bare and wide.&rdquo; <a name="citation87"></a><a
href="#footnote87" class="citation">[87]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Ser Brunetto was despatched on very urgent business, it may
be presumed that he was journeying by the most direct road which
he could find.&nbsp; Until the reign of Charlemagne indeed there
were but few towns, and consequently few roads, in Germany.&nbsp;
The population generally was widely spread over the surface of
the land.&nbsp; &ldquo;A house, with its stables and
farm-buildings,&rdquo; says Mr. Hallam, &ldquo;surrounded by a
hedge or inclosure, was called a court, or as we find it in our
law-books, a curtilage: the toft or homestead of a more genuine
English dialect.&nbsp; One of these, with the adjacent arable
fields and woods, had the name of a villa or manse.&nbsp; Several
manses composed a march; and several marches formed a Pagus, or
district.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was indeed little temptation or need
to move from place to place, when nearly <!-- page 88--><a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>every article
of consumption was produced or wrought at home.&nbsp; For several
centuries there is perhaps not a vestige to be discovered of any
considerable manufacture.&nbsp; Each district furnished for
itself its own articles of common utility.&nbsp; Rich men kept
domestic artizans among their servants; even kings, in the ninth
century, had their clothes made by the women upon their
farms.&nbsp; The weaver, the smith, and the currier were often
born and bred on the estate where they pursued their several
crafts.</p>
<p>The position of Rome as the ecclesiastical metropolis of the
world caused both a general and periodical recourse of embassies,
deputations, pilgrims, and travellers to the Italian peninsula,
yet we cannot discover that any especial conveniences were
provided for the wayfarers.&nbsp; Even in the great and solemn
years of the Jubilee the roads were merely patched up, and the
bridges temporarily repaired by the Roman government, and only in
such places as had become actually impassable.&nbsp; The floating
capital of the more commercial of the Italian Republics was
employed rather upon their docks and arsenals than upon their
roads and causeways.&nbsp; Venice indeed, which for central
vigour was the most genuine offspring of Imperial Rome, paved its
continental possessions with broad thoroughfares.&nbsp; But
neither Padua, Ravenna, nor Florence followed the example of the
Adriatic Queen.&nbsp; On the contrary, Dante, when in his descent
<!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>to Hell he meets with any peculiarly difficult or
precipitous track, frequently compares it to some road well known
to his countrymen, which fallen rocks had blocked up, or a wintry
flood had rendered impermeable.&nbsp; Spain presented, as it
presents at this day, to the engineer, almost insurmountable
difficulties.&nbsp; The Moorish provinces of the south alone
possessed any tolerable roads; nor were the ways of Arragon or
Castile mended after the wealth of Mexico and Peru had been
poured into the Spanish exchequer.&nbsp; Portugal owed its first
good roads in modern times to its good king Emmanuel; and the
Dutch and Flemings, the most commercial people of Europe from the
thirteenth to the eighteenth centuries, found in their rivers and
canals an easier transit than roads would have afforded them, for
the wares which they brought from Archangel on the one hand and
from the Spice Islands on the other.&nbsp; The military
restlessness of France indeed led to the earlier formation of
great roads.&nbsp; Yet France was a land long divided in itself;
and the Duchies of Burgundy and Bretagne had little in common
with the enterprising spirit of Paris, Lyons, and
Marseilles.&nbsp; Upon the whole the roads of England, bad as
they were, were at least upon a par with those of the
Continent.</p>
<p>In this retrospect, hasty and imperfect as it is, we must not
pass over the roads of Asia.&nbsp; And here ancient history
affords us at least glimpses of <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>definite
knowledge.&nbsp; In that portion of the Asiatic continent which
is seated between the Euxine Sea, the chain of Mount Taurus, and
the &AElig;gean, the crowded population, the activity of the
Greek colonies, and the necessity for direct communication with
the interior and seat of government, led to the construction of
good and uniform highways.&nbsp; In the Ionian Revolt large
bodies of troops were readily brought to bear upon the
insurgents, and the preparations of Xerxes for his invasion of
Greece cannot have been made without a previous provision of
military roads.&nbsp; An exact scale of taxation was drawn up by
Darius Hystaspes for all the provinces of his vast empire; and as
the system survived the extinction of the royal house of Persia,
and was adopted by the Macedonian conquerors in all its more
important details, it may be inferred that such system worked
with tolerable regularity and success.&nbsp; But as the tithes
and tolls of Persia were paid both in money and in kind, it is
obvious that the communication between the capital and satrapies
of the empire must have been well organized.&nbsp; Such
organization implies the existence of main roads radiating from
Sousa and Ecbatana.&nbsp; Nor are we left to conjecture
only.&nbsp; The establishment of running posts and couriers was a
distinguishing feature of the Persian empire; and the speed at
which they journeyed from the sea-coast or the banks of the
Hyphasis to the seat of government proves that the roads were in
good <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>order and the stations and relays of runners well
ascertained.&nbsp; The Anabasis of Cyrus&mdash;his &ldquo;march
up&rdquo; the country&mdash;affords another proof.&nbsp; The
narrative of Xenophon, in its earlier portions at least, and so
long as the ten thousand Greeks kept to the main roads, resembles
in the precision with which it marks distances and stations a
Roman Itinerary or a Bradshaw&rsquo;s Guide.&nbsp; On this day,
says the historical captain of mercenaries, we marched seven
parasangs and bivouacked in an empty fort; on such a day we
marched five parasangs and encamped in a pleasant park or
&lsquo;paradise&rsquo; of the great king.&nbsp; It is only after
the Greeks have been forced from the &lsquo;Road-down&rsquo; by
the clouds of Persian cavalry, that they enter upon more rugged
and devious mountain-paths.&nbsp; The account of Xenophon is
confirmed by Arrian in his history of Alexander&rsquo;s Anabasis;
and so long as the Macedonian conqueror was within the bounds of
Persia proper, we rarely meet with any impediments to his
progress arising out of the badness of the roads.</p>
<p>We have made some mention of the more conspicuous of ancient
travellers.&nbsp; But travelling, either for business or
pleasure, among the moderns, dates from the era of the
Crusades.&nbsp; The barriers of the East were once again thrown
open by that general ferment in the European world.&nbsp; Piety,
the passion of enterprise, the dawning instincts of commerce, a
new thirst for exotic luxuries, all contributed to inspire a
desire for exploring the <!-- page 92--><a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>seats of the
most ancient civilization.&nbsp; To this desire and to its
effects we owe some of the most graphic and entertaining of
modern writings.&nbsp; If we were, through any misadventure, sent
to jail, we would stipulate for permission to carry into our cell
Hakluyt&rsquo;s Voyages.&nbsp; The narratives of modern
travellers are often learned, more often flimsy, and from the
universality of locomotion, much given, like the prayers of the
old Pharisees, to tedious repetitions.&nbsp; A tour in Greece or
Italy now affects us with unutterable weariness.&nbsp; A journey
from London to York affords more real novelty than many of these
excursions.&nbsp; Sir Charles Fellows or Mr. Layard write in the
spirit of the old travellers, and we would willingly wander
any-whither with George Borrow.&nbsp; But, for the most part, the
art of writing travels is lost&mdash;its imaginativeness, its
credulity, its cherishing of mystery, and its proneness to
awe.&nbsp; The old travellers are never sentimental&mdash;and
sentiment is the very bane of road-books,&mdash;and they never
describe for description&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; The world was much
too wonderful in their eyes for such unprofitable excursions of
fancy.&nbsp; Beauty and danger, difficulty and strangeness, novel
fashions and unknown garbs, were to them earnest and absorbing
realities.&nbsp; The aspect of cities and havens, and leagues of
forest and solitary plains, were to them &ldquo;as a banner broad
unfurled,&rdquo; and inscribed with mystic signs and
legends.&nbsp; They were not whirled about from place to <!--
page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>place: they had leisure to mark the forms and the
colours of objects.&nbsp; They were in perils often: if they
escaped shipwreck they were in danger of slavery; they journeyed
with their lives in their hands, and were often yoke-fellows with
hunger and nakedness, and the fury of the elements.&nbsp; Luckily
for us who read their narratives, they were most unscientific,
and ascribed the howling of the night-wind, the bursting of
icebergs, the noise of tempests, and the echoes that traverse
boundless plains after great heats, or are imprisoned in rock and
fell, to the voice of demons exulting or lamenting to each
other.&nbsp; We now cross the desert with nearly as much ease as
we hail an omnibus, or book ourselves for Paris.&nbsp; But such
was not the spirit in which Marco Polo, in the thirteenth,
century, traversed the wilderness of Lop.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the city of Lop,&rdquo; says the hardy
and veracious merchant of Venice, &ldquo;they who desire to pass
over the desert cause all necessaries to be provided for them;
and when victuals begin to fail in the desert, they kill their
camels and asses and eat them.&nbsp; They mostly make it their
choice to use camels, because they are sustained with little
meat, and bear great burdens.&nbsp; They must purvey victuals for
a month to cross it only, for to go through it lengthways would
require a year&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; They go through the sands and
barren mountains, and daily find water; yet at times it is so
little that it will hardly suffice fifty or a hundred men with
<!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>their beasts; and in three or four places the water is
salt and bitter.&nbsp; The rest of the road, for eight-and-twenty
days, is very good.&nbsp; In it there are not either beasts or
birds; they say that there dwell many spirits in this wilderness,
which cause great and marvellous illusions to travellers, and
make them perish; for if any stay behind, and cannot see his
company, he shall be called by his name, and so going out of the
way be lost. <a name="citation94a"></a><a href="#footnote94a"
class="citation">[94a]</a>&nbsp; In night they hear as it were
the noise of a company, which, taking to be theirs, they perish
likewise.&nbsp; Concerts of musical instruments are sometimes
heard in the air, like noise of drums and armies. <a
name="citation94b"></a><a href="#footnote94b"
class="citation">[94b]</a>&nbsp; They go therefore close
together, hang bells on their beasts&rsquo; neck, and set marks,
if any stray.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Hebrews, dispersed over every region of the world,
civilized or uncivilized, were necessarily <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>great
travellers.&nbsp; There was, in the first place, their central
connection with Palestine, which they generally visited once in
their lives, and whither thousands of them, as age advanced,
flocked to lay their bones.&nbsp; There were the claims of
kindred, prompting them to seek out and visit the children of
dispersion, whether seated on the banks of the Vistula, the
Euphrates, or the Nile; and there were the incentives of
commerce, which drew them through the perils of land and
sea.&nbsp; From the instructions given to their travelling agents
in the medieval period, we derive much curious information
respecting the internal state of Europe.&nbsp; It were indeed
much to be wished that competent Hebrew scholars, instead of
devoting themselves to the inane obscurity of the Rabbins, would
employ their learning upon the history of the Jews in the Middle
Ages.&nbsp; Much curious and interesting knowledge might be
disinterred from the piles of Hebrew manuscripts that now lie
amid the dust and spiders&rsquo; webs of the Escurial.&nbsp;
Above all things the itineraries of the Jewish travellers should
be explored, as containing probably the most minute and accurate
description of the social state of Europe at that period.&nbsp;
Both for their personal security and for the despatch of their
affairs, it was essential for the Jews to obtain and circulate
the most exact information of the markets and population of the
cities on their route.&nbsp; They required to know whom to shun
and whom to seek; the towns in which the <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>Jews&rsquo;
quarter was most commodious and secure; and the intervening
tracts, often many days&rsquo; journey in extent, which were most
free from robbers or feudal oppressors.&nbsp; The following draft
of instructions for a Spanish Jew, whose occasions led him from
Spain to Greece, will afford the reader some conception of the
historical value of such itineraries.&nbsp; Its date is
apparently not later than the sixteenth century:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whoever wants to go from Saragossa, Huesca,
Teruel, or any other town in Arragon, to Constantinople, the
great city where the Turk reigns, must follow the route herein
contained, and beware of the dangers that we are going to
specify.&nbsp; The fugitive must first of all go to Jaca, where
they will ask him the object of his voyage; he must say that he
escapes to France, on account of his creditors, and he will not
be disturbed.&nbsp; Thence he will go to Canfranc, and thence to
Oleron, the first town in France, where, if questioned respecting
the object of his voyage, he must say that he is going on a
pilgrimage to Our Lady of Loretto.&nbsp; From Oleron to Pau, to
Tarbes, to Toulouse, to Gaillac, to Villefranche, and to Lyons:
in this latter place the traveller will be obliged to show
whatever money he carries, and pay one out of every forty pieces,
whether silver or gold.&nbsp; At Lyons he will ask his way to
Milan, and say that he is going to visit St. Mark of Venice; but
when within five leagues of the former city, he must leave it on
the right, and <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>pass behind the mountain, so as not
to enter the territory of the emperor.&nbsp; From thence he must
direct his course towards the State of Venice; and when he
arrives at Verona, not go through the city, for they make every
one pay one real at the gates.&nbsp; In Verona he must ask his
way to Padua, where he will embark on the river and go to Venice;
the passage will cost him half a real.&nbsp; He will land on the
Piazza di San Marco, and then he must look out for an inn to go
to; he must be cautious in making his bargain with the innkeeper
first; he must not pay more than half a real a day for his bed;
and he is warned not to let the landlord provide him with
anything, for he will charge him double for everything.&nbsp; On
the day after his arrival he must go to the Piazza di San Marco,
and there he will see some men with white turbans, and others
with yellow; the first are Turks, the latter Jews.&nbsp; From
these he will get every assistance and advice, whether he wants
to go to Salonica or to any port of Greece.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time when Marco Polo, Rubruquis, Benjamin of Tudela,
etc., journeyed in Asia, the East was still unspoiled&mdash;it
was still the authentic Ophir of gold and barbaric pearl, and
gorgeous armour, and solemn processions.&nbsp; At the same time
Asia was but little behind Europe in the general elements of
civilization, so that the contrast which is so glaring at the
present day, between the state of a sultan and a pasha, and the
squalid poverty of his <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>subjects and servants, was then less
startling.&nbsp; The courts of Europe were comparatively poor and
mean, while the palaces of the oriental monarchs powerfully
affected the imagination of the traveller.&nbsp; At a time too
when the manners of the European nobility exhibited little
refinement, the dignified courtesy and elaborate ceremonies of
Bagdad and Ispahan were not less imposing than the pomp and
splendour of their garb and its decorations.&nbsp; The Eastern
chivalry also was to the full as efficient as that of the West;
for what it lacked in weight of metal, it gained in superior
adroitness in the use of weapons, in the greater facility of its
movements, and the better temper and flexibility of its
armour.&nbsp; All these features of a high&mdash;though, as it
proved, a less enduring&mdash;civilization are noted with wonder
and applause by the early travellers, who cannot sufficiently
express their admiration of such opulence and such brilliant
displays.</p>
<p>But for our immediate purpose, we can only speak of the great
roads and inns of &ldquo;Cathaian Khan.&rdquo;&nbsp; Marco Polo
thus describes the great roads and excellent inns in the
neighbourhood of Cambalu.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There are many public roads from the city
of Cambalu, which conduct to the neighbouring provinces, and in
every one of them, at the end of five-and-twenty or thirty miles,
are lodgings or inns built, called <i>lambs</i>, that is,
post-houses, with large and fair courts, chambers furnished with
beds and other provisions, every way fit to entertain great <!--
page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>men, nay, even to lodge a king.&nbsp; The provisions are
laid in from the country adjacent: there are about four hundred
horses, which are in readiness for messengers and ambassadors,
who there leave their tired horses, and take fresh; and in
mountainous places, where are no villages, the Great Khan sends
people to inhabit, about ten thousand at a place, where these
lambs or post-houses are built, and the people cultivating the
ground for their provisions.&nbsp; These excellent regulations
continue unto the utmost limits of the empire, so that, on the
public ways throughout the whole of the Khan&rsquo;s dominions,
about ten thousand of the king&rsquo;s inns are found; and the
number of the horses appointed for the service of the messengers
in those inns are more than two hundred thousand&mdash;a thing
almost incredible: hence it is that in a little while, with
change of men and horses, intelligence comes, without stop, to
the court.&nbsp; The horses are employed by turns, so that of the
four hundred, two hundred are in the stables ready, the other two
hundred at grass, each a month at a time.&nbsp; Their cities
also, that are adjoining to rivers and lakes, are appointed to
have ferry-boats in readiness for the posts, and cities on the
borders of deserts are directed to have horses and provisions for
the use of such as pass through those deserts: and they have a
reasonable allowance for this service from the Khan.&nbsp; In
cases of great moment the posts will ride two hundred miles
a-day, or <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>sometimes two hundred and
fifty.&nbsp; Also they ride all night, foot-posts running by them
with lights, if the moon does not shine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are also between these inns other habitations,
three or four miles distant from one another, in which there are
a few houses, where foot-posts live, having each of them his
girdle hung full of shrill-sounding bells.&nbsp; These keep
themselves always ready, and as often as the Khan&rsquo;s letters
are sent to them convey them speedily to the posts at the next
village, who, hearing the sound of the foot-post coming when at a
distance, expect him and receive his letters, and presently carry
them to the next watch; and so, the letters passing through
several hands, are conveyed, without delay, to the place whither
they ought to come; and it often happens that by this the king
learns news, or receives new fruits, from a place ten days&rsquo;
journey distant, in two days.&nbsp; As, for instance, fruits
growing at Cambalu in the morning, by the next day at night are
at Xanadu.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such were the general features of the old roads of Asia and
Europe centuries ago.&nbsp; But it must be regarded as one of the
caprices of civilization that the only roads, in the fifteenth
century, which rivalled the Roman Vi&aelig;, were constructed in
another hemisphere, and by a people whom the Europeans were wont
to regard with disdain, as barbarous.&nbsp; The gold and silver
furniture of the Peruvian palaces excited the cupidity of the
Spanish <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>invaders; but even avarice, for a
moment, yielded to admiration, when the file-leaders of
Pizarro&rsquo;s columns beheld for the first time the great Roads
of the Incas.&nbsp; The Peruvians have been eloquently vindicated
from the charge of barbarism by a modern historian, native of the
great continent which Columbus discovered.&nbsp; From the moment
when Cortes had gained the crest of the sierra of Ahualco, his
progress was comparatively easy.&nbsp; Broad and even roads or
long and solid causeways across the lakes and marshes conducted
the Spaniards and their allies through the valley of Mexico or
Tenochtitlan; and as they descended from the regions of sleet and
snow, a gay and gorgeous panorama greeted them on every side,
&ldquo;of water, woodland, and cultivated plains,&rdquo;
diversified with bold and shadowy hills, and studded with the
roofs and towers of populous cities.&nbsp; The running posts of
the Aztecs rivalled in speed and regularity their brethren in
Cathay, and Montezuma could boast that his dominions displayed at
least one element of civilization&mdash;rapid communication
between the provinces and the capital&mdash;which in that age and
long afterwards was unknown to the empire of his rival and
conqueror, the &lsquo;white king beyond the seas.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The roads of Peru were however more wonderful than even those of
Mexico.&nbsp; We now borrow Mr. Prescott&rsquo;s description.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Those,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;who may
distrust the accounts of Peruvian industry, will find their
doubts <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>removed on a visit to the
country.&nbsp; The traveller still meets, especially in the
regions of the tableland, with memorials of the past, remains of
temples, palaces, fortresses, terraced mountains, great military
roads, aqueducts, and other public works, which, whatever degree
of science they may display in their execution, astonish him by
their number, the massive character of the materials, and the
grandeur of the design.&nbsp; Among them, perhaps the most
remarkable are the great roads, the broken remains of which are
still in sufficient preservation to attest their former
magnificence.&nbsp; There were many of their roads traversing
different parts of the kingdom; but the most considerable were
the two which extended from Quito to Cuzco, and again diverging
from the capital, continued in a southern direction towards
Chili.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of these roads passed over the grand plateau, and
the other along the lowlands on the borders of the ocean.&nbsp;
The former was much the more difficult achievement, from the
character of the country.&nbsp; It was conducted over pathless
sierras buried in snow; galleries were cut for leagues through
the living rock; rivers were crossed by means of bridges that
swung suspended in the air; precipices were scaled by stair-ways
hewn out of the native bed; ravines of hideous depth were filled
up with solid masonry: in short, all the difficulties that beset
a wild and mountainous region, and which might appal the most
courageous engineer <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>of modern times, were encountered
and successfully overcome.&nbsp; The length of the road, of which
scattered fragments only remain, is variously estimated at from
fifteen hundred to two thousand miles, and stone pillars, in the
manner of European milestones, were erected at stated intervals
of somewhat more than a league, all along the route.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other great road of the Incas lay through the level
country between the Andes and the ocean.&nbsp; It was constructed
in a different manner, as demanded by the nature of the ground,
which was for the most part low, and much of it sandy.&nbsp; The
causeway was raised on a high embankment of earth, and defended
on either side by a parapet or wall of clay; and trees and
odoriferous shrubs were placed along the margin, regaling the
sense of the traveller with their perfume, and refreshing him by
their shade, so grateful under the burning sky of the
tropics.&nbsp; In the midst of sandy wastes, which occasionally
intervened, where the light and volatile soil was incapable of
sustaining a road, huge piles were driven into the ground to
indicate the route of the traveller.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Prescott might have added, that these magnificent works
were constructed by a people ignorant of the use of iron, and
unsupplied with wheel-carriages.&nbsp; The only beast of burden
was the llama; and the long files of these patient and docile
animals, winding along the broad causeways of the Andes recalled
to the invaders the long <!-- page 104--><a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>strings of
mules stepping in single file along the rocky paths cut out from
the sides of the Iberian sierras.&nbsp; Iron and fire-arms alone
were wanting to the Peruvians to enable them to rival the most
potent of the European kingdoms both in the arts and arms which
maintain empires.</p>
<p>Of New Roads we shall speak very briefly, and rather of their
effects than of their history.&nbsp; It would indeed be idle, in
a rapid sketch like the present, to be diffuse upon a subject
which those who travel may study with their own eyes, and those
who stay at home may learn from many excellent recent books. <a
name="citation104"></a><a href="#footnote104"
class="citation">[104]</a></p>
<p>The defiance of natural obstacles, the massive piles of
masonry, the filling up of valleys, the perforated hill, the arch
bestriding the river or the morass, the attraction of towns
towards the line of transit, the creation of new markets, the
connection of inland cities with the coast, the interweaving of
populations hitherto isolated from one another, the increase of
land-carriage, the running to and fro of thousands whose fathers
were born and died in the same town or the same
district,&mdash;all these are features in common with the
Flaminian and &AElig;milian ways, and with the roads laid down by
the genius and enterprise of Stephenson.&nbsp; <!-- page 105--><a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>The old and
the new roads, both in their resemblance and in their difference,
suggest and express many of the organic distinctions and
affinities of the old and the new phases of civilization.</p>
<p>For, apart from a feature of distinction already noticed, that
in the ancient world all or nearly all public works were executed
by and for the State, we may here remark that in England
especially, where centralization is feeble, and local or personal
interests are strong, the construction and conduct&mdash;the
<i>curatio</i>, as the Romans phrased it&mdash;of great roads are
entirely in the hands of voluntary associations, and the State
interferes so far only as to shield individual life and property
from wanton wrong and aggression.&nbsp; Secondly, that the
primary purpose of the Roman Vi&aelig; was that of extending and
securing conquest, while the primary end of the railroad is to
diffuse and facilitate commerce.&nbsp; In the one case,
civilization was a fortunate accident.&nbsp; Gaul imbibed the
arts and manners of Latium, because Gaul had been first subdued,
and was permanently held by the strong Roman arm.&nbsp; But, in
the other case, traffic and communication are the direct objects,
while war, if hereafter wars should arise, will be the crime or
the infelicity of those who engage in it.&nbsp; War indeed, as
all ancient history shows, was the normal condition of
Heathendom; Peace, although so often in the past ages rudely
interrupted, is the normal state of Christendom.&nbsp; Again, the
Roman <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>road rendered invasion,
encroachment, and the lust of conquest easy to project, execute,
and gratify; whereas the modern Vi&aelig;, by bringing nations
into speedy and immediate contact with one another, are
diminishing with each year the chances of hostile
collision.&nbsp; The Roman roads, with all their magnificent
apparatus of bridges, causeways, of uplifted hollows and levelled
heights, were constructed at an enormous cost of manual labour
and of personal oppression and suffering, and with comparatively
a trifling amount of science.&nbsp; But the railroad is the idea
of the philosopher embodied by the free and cheerfully accorded
toil of the labourer and artizan.&nbsp; When an Appius Claudius
or a Marcus Flaminius determined to mark the year of his
consulship or censorship by some colossal road-work, the
husbandman was summoned from his field, the herdsman was brought
from his pasture-ground, a contingent was demanded from the
allies, a conscription was enforced upon the subjects of Rome,
harder task-work was imposed on the slave, and more irksome
punishment inflicted upon the prisoner. <a
name="citation107"></a><a href="#footnote107"
class="citation">[107]</a>&nbsp; The great works of antiquity
indeed, from the pyramids downward to <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>the
mausoleum of Hadrian, are too often the monuments of human toil,
privation, and death.&nbsp; But the roads of our more fortunate
times are not cemented with the tears of myriads, nor reared upon
piles of bleached bones.&nbsp; On the contrary, the construction
of them has given employment to thousands who, but for them,
would have crowded to the parish for relief, or have wandered
anxiously in search of work, or sauntered listlessly at the
alehouse door in despair of finding it.&nbsp; The great radii of
peaceful communication have been executed by willing hands, and a
fair day&rsquo;s wages has been the recompense of a fair
day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; We do not undervalue the skill and energy
of the engineers of antiquity.&nbsp; Yet by their fruits we know
and judge of the works of the Curatores Viarum, and of our
Brunels and Stephensons.&nbsp; &ldquo;Peace has its victories no
less than war.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the modern road does not more
surpass the ancient in the science of its constructors, than in
the objects for which it has been planned and executed.</p>
<p>But before these results were attained, the air was tried, and
the water was tried, as likely to afford a more rapid medium of
transit and communication than the solid earth.&nbsp; Of balloons
and canals however our limits do not permit us to speak, although
either of them might well furnish <!-- page 108--><a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>a little
volume like the one now presented to the reader.&nbsp; We are now
concerned, however, with the social and civilizing effects of
Railways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a succession of ages,&rdquo; says Dr. Lardner,
&ldquo;the little intercourse that was maintained between the
various parts of Great Britain was effected almost exclusively by
rude footpaths, traversed by pedestrians, or at best by
horses.&nbsp; Hills were surmounted, valleys crossed, and rivers
forded by these rude agents of transport, in the same manner as
the savage and settler of the backwoods of America or the slopes
of the Rocky Mountains communicate with each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The effects of high civilization may perhaps be best estimated
by its contrast&mdash;the rude and infant stages of
society.&nbsp; Let us imagine for a moment the destruction of
Railways, the neglect of Turnpike and Highway Roads, and the
consequent interruption of our present modes of rapid and regular
locomotion.</p>
<p>Gentle Reader, in the first place, your breakfast is rendered
thoroughly uncomfortable, or, like Viola&rsquo;s history&mdash;a
blank.&nbsp; Your copy of the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Morning Chronicle&rsquo; has not arrived; your letters are
lying six miles off, and you have to send a special
messenger&mdash;who may, and will most probably, get drunk on his
road&mdash;to fetch them.&nbsp; If you should chance to be in
business, you will hear of a profitable investment for capital
just two hours after some one else has closed the bargain; if you
are a <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>physician, you will most probably
miss a lucrative patient; if a lawyer, a most seductive
fee.&nbsp; All calculations will be disturbed.&nbsp; Manchester
and Norwich will be more remote from each other than Paris and
Marseilles.&nbsp; In place of a railway station there will be a
swamp, and instead of a turnpike gate, a wood.&nbsp; Mighty towns
and spacious cities will shrink into obscure villages; smiling
and fertile districts relapse into original barrenness; kinsfolk
and acquaintance be put nearly out of sight.&nbsp; There are no
mails; there is no penny post; the last new novel will not reach
you.&nbsp; The Bishop of Exeter may become a cardinal, or Colonel
Sibthorpe commander of the forces, six weeks before you hear of
their promotion.&nbsp; The union between Scotland and England
will be again as good as divorced by distance and difficulty of
transit.&nbsp; Your fish from Billingsgate will be ancient, and
your tailor will be sure to disappoint you of your mourning or
your marriage suit.&nbsp; Your commodious carpet-bag must be
exchanged for a trunk capacious enough to contain all your
&ldquo;household stuff,&rdquo; except the kitchen range; your
utmost speed will amount to difficult stages of six miles an
hour; you will journey in terror; and you will arrive at your inn
with the fixed determination of never again quitting your
home.</p>
<p>We will conclude our rambles over the old roads of four
continents with the words of one whose wisdom was not surpassed
by his wit, although his wit surpassed most of the wisdom of his
contemporaries.&nbsp; <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>&ldquo;It is of some
importance,&rdquo; says Sydney Smith, (it is wrong to add
&lsquo;the Reverend,&rsquo; for no one says <i>Mr.</i> William
Shakspeare or <i>Mr.</i> John Milton,) &ldquo;at what period a
man is born.&nbsp; A young man alive at this period hardly knows
to what improvement of human life he has been introduced; and I
would bring before his notice the changes which have taken place
in England since I began to breathe the breath of life&mdash;a
period amounting to seventy years.&nbsp; Gas was unknown.&nbsp; I
groped about the streets of London in all but utter darkness of a
twinkling oil lamp, under the protection of watchmen in their
grand climacteric, and exposed to every species of degradation
and insult.&nbsp; I have been nine hours in sailing from Dover to
Calais, before the invention of steam.&nbsp; It took me nine
hours to go from Taunton to Bath before the invention of
railroads, and I now go in six hours from Taunton to
London!&nbsp; In going from Taunton to Bath I suffered between
ten thousand and twelve thousand severe contusions, before
stone-breaking Macadam was born.&nbsp; I paid fifteen pounds in a
single year for repairs of carriage-springs on the pavement of
London, and I now glide without noise or fracture on wooden
pavement.&nbsp; I can walk, by the assistance of the police, from
one end of London to the other without molestation; or, if tired,
get into a cheap and active cab, instead of those cottages on
wheels which the hackney coaches were at the beginning of my
life.&nbsp; Whatever miseries I suffered, there <!-- page
111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>was no post to whisk my complaints for a single penny
to the remotest corners of the empire; and yet, in spite of all
these privations, I lived on quietly, and am now ashamed that I
was not more discontented, and utterly surprised that all these
changes and inventions did not occur two centuries ago.&nbsp; I
forgot to add that, as the basket of stagecoaches in which the
luggage was then carried had no springs, your clothes were rubbed
all to pieces; and that, even in the best society, one-third of
the gentlemen at least were always drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, Gentle Reader, have we not kept both troth and tryste
with you?&nbsp; We put it to you seriously, did you ever chance
to read a more rambling volume than the one now presented to
you?&nbsp; You may talk to a pleasant companion in your first or
second class carriage without losing the thread of our argument;
you may indulge in a comfortable nap without its being necessary
for you to mark the page where you dropped off.&nbsp; It may be
better to begin at the beginning, and read in ordinary fashion to
the close.&nbsp; But it will not be much worse if you have a
fancy for commencing with the end.&nbsp; In short, you cannot go
wrong, so you do but read in a charitable spirit&mdash;not being
extreme to mark the much which is amiss.</p>
<p>Finally, we entreat of you to read this book in the temper
which a certain English worthy recommends for his own.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One or two things yet I was desirous to
have amended, if I could, concerning the manner of <!-- page
112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>handling this my subject, for which I must apologize,
<i>deprecari</i>, and upon better advice give the friendly reader
notice.&nbsp; I neglect phrases, and labour wholly to inform my
reader&rsquo;s understanding, not to please his ear.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis my study to express myself readily and plainly as it
happens: so that, as a river runs, sometimes precipitate and
swift, then dull and slow: now direct, then <i>per ambages</i>:
now deep, then shallow: now muddy, then clear: now broad, then
narrow; doth my style flow now serious, then light, as the
present subject required, or as at the time I was affected.&nbsp;
And if thou vouchsafe to read this Treatise, it shall seem to
thee no otherwise than the way to an ordinary traveller,
sometimes fair, sometimes foul; here champion, there enclosed;
barren in one place, better soil in another.&nbsp; By woods,
groves, hills, dales, plains, and lead thee <i>per ardua montium
et lubrica vallium et roscida cespitum et glebosa camporum</i>,
through variety of objects, to that which thou shalt like or
haply dislike.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If thou art scholarly, Gentle Reader, running to and fro on
Old or New Roads may do thee good.&nbsp; It will afford thee time
to rest eye and hand, and furnish thee with more glimpses of this
working world than are to be seen from a library-window.&nbsp;
But if it chance that thou be not clerkly, then mayest thou both
&lsquo;run to and fro&rsquo; and &lsquo;increase thy
knowledge&rsquo; even with the aid of so poor a guide as he who
now bids thee &ldquo;Heartily Farewell.&rdquo;</p>

unrivalled knight, &ldquo;but as often as I call to mind my
unhappy spouse, my eyes are brim-full.&nbsp; With what
stateliness did he use to carry my lady behind him on a puissant
mule, for in those days coaches and side-saddles were not in
fashion, and the ladies rode behind their squires.&nbsp; On a
certain day, at the entrance into St. James&rsquo;s Street in
Madrid, which is very narrow, a judge of one of the courts
happened to be coming out with two of his officers, and as soon
as my good squire saw him&mdash;so well-bred and punctilious was
my husband&mdash;he turned his mule about, as if he designed to
wait upon him home.&nbsp; My lady, who was behind him, said to
him in a low voice, &lsquo;What are you doing, blockhead? am I
not here?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Judge civilly stopped his horse and
said, &lsquo;Keep on your way, Sir, for it is my business rather
to wait on my lady Donna Casilda.&rsquo;&nbsp; My husband
persisted, cap in hand, in his intention to wait upon the Judge,
which my lady perceiving, full of choler and indignation, she
pulled out a great pin and stuck it into his back; whereupon my
husband bawled out, and, writhing his body, down he came with his
lady to the ground.&nbsp; My mistress was forced to walk home on
foot, and my husband went to a barber-surgeon&rsquo;s, telling
him he was run quite through and through the bowels.&nbsp; But

that &ldquo;the amazing large signs which, at the entrance of
villages, hang in the middle of the street, being fastened to
large beams, which are extended across the street from one house
to another opposite to it, particularly struck me.&nbsp; These
sign-posts have the appearance of gates, or gateways, for which I
at first took them, but the whole apparatus, unnecessarily large
as it seems to be, is intended for nothing more than to tell the
inquisitive traveller that there is an inn.&rdquo;&nbsp; It marks
in some degree the territorial prejudices of the English people
that the principal inn of a hamlet usually &ldquo;hangs
out&rdquo; the crest of the family, if it be indeed an ancient
house, at the neighbouring hall or great house, whether it be a
Swan, a Griffin, a St. George, or other heraldic or historic
emblem or hero.</p>
<p><a name="footnote87"></a><a href="#citation87"
class="footnote">[87]</a>&nbsp; We have availed ourselves of Mr.
Cary&rsquo;s skilful translation of Brunetto&rsquo;s description
of his journey from Florence to Valladolid, whither he had been
sent on an embassy by the Guelph party:&mdash;&ldquo;Un
scolaio&mdash;Sur un muletto baio,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p><a name="footnote94a"></a><a href="#citation94a"
class="footnote">[94a]</a>&nbsp; It is perhaps scarcely necessary
to observe how much indebted our great poets have been to the
early travellers.&nbsp; Milton had perhaps this passage in his
memory when he wrote the speech of the Lady in
&lsquo;Comus&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A
thousand fantasies<br />
Begin to throng into my memory,<br />
Of calling shapes, and beck&rsquo;ning shadows dire,<br />
And aery tongues, that syllable men&rsquo;s names<br />
On sands and shores and desert wildernesses.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="footnote94b"></a><a href="#citation94b"
class="footnote">[94b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;The isle is full of
noises,<br />
Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.<br />
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments<br />
Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices,<br />
That, if I then had wak&rsquo;d after long sleep,<br />
Will make me sleep again.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Tempest</i>, act iii.
sc. 2.</p>
<p><a name="footnote104"></a><a href="#citation104"
class="footnote">[104]</a>&nbsp; Among the most satisfactory of
such works, we would especially mention &lsquo;A History of the
English Railway,&rsquo; by John Francis, in two volumes, 8vo, to
which our own sketch is under great obligations.</p>
<p><a name="footnote107"></a><a href="#citation107"

<i>Curator Viarum</i> resembled very nearly the accompaniments of
a modern Railway contractor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Caius Gracchus,&rdquo;
says Plutarch, &ldquo;was appointed supreme director for making
roads, etc.&nbsp; The people were charmed to see him followed by
such numbers of architects, artificers, ambassadors, and
magistrates: and he applied to the whole with as much activity,
and despatched it with as much ease, as if there had been only
one thing for him to attend to: insomuch that they who both hated
and feared the man were struck with his amazing industry, and the
celerity of his operations.&rdquo;</p>

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
